I am sorry to flog a dead horse - but the current TTB regulations do NOT
allow any personal production of distilled spirits (where distilled in
other sections include freezing, reverse osmosis, or any other method of
concentration).? That being said, the government does not generally seek
out small violators, so unless you advertise or try to set up competitions,
you are probably under their radar, and enjoy.? MY read on this simply
comes from the Frequently Asked Questions portions of the TTB web
site at?BOTH ?http://www.ttb.gov/faqs/genalcohol.shtml#g1? which
I have copy/pasted below, and an idenically worded?answer
at?http://www.ttb.gov/spirits/faq.shtml#s7?.? Note that both the BEER and
WINE sections, when expanded, show the 100 gallon personal and 200 gallons
household exemption for personal or family use.? The TTB has also defined
wine as made at home even if it is made at a?"Home Winemaker's Center"
in?http://www.ttb.gov/wine/faq.shtml#w4?}.?
Not so with spirits.? So, iced beer is still OK, as is ice wine - by ANY
method -?as long as they stay within the definitions of beer and wine.?

General Alcohol FAQs

Revised: 04/06

G1: Can I produce beer, wine or spirits for my personal or family use
without paying Federal excise tax and filing Federal paperwork?

Beer

Production.?????????????????? {Says OK for 100 gallons personal & 200
gallons household}

Removal of beer.

Wine

Wine for personal or family use.???????? {Says OK for 100/200 gallons at
home or remote locations}

Spirits

You cannot produce spirits for beverage purposes without paying
taxes and without prior approval of paperwork to operate a distilled
spirits plant.? [See 26 U.S.C. 5601 & 5602 for some of the criminal
penalties.]? There are numerous requirements that must be met that make
it impractical to produce spirits for personal or beverage use.? Some of
these requirements are paying excise tax, filing an extensive application,
filing a bond, providing adequate equipment to measure spirits, providing
suitable tanks and pipelines, providing a separate building (other than
a dwelling) and maintaining detailed records, and filing reports.? All of
these requirements are listed in 27 CFR Part 19.

Lou, Louis J. LeBlanc, provided us with two  links:
   _http://www.ttb.gov/forms_tutorials/glossary/letter_c.html#C_18_
(http://www.ttb.gov/forms_tutorials/glossary/letter_c.html#C_18)
_http://www.ttb.gov/forms_tutorials/glossary_nf.shtml_
(http://www.ttb.gov/forms_tutorials/glossary_nf.shtml) .

I hope every one has read both of those  links.

Two of the benefits of Mead Digest are the altruism of Dick Dunn
who continues to publish the Digest at his own expense and the
excellent input we receive from knowledgeable Meadmakers.  I am
always grateful for both.  As far as I am concerned, Lou has made
a significant addition to the second benefit.
