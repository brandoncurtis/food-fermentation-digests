Subject: Mouthfeel question

Hello folks,

Some of you will remember that I asked a question awhile back about chamomile
mead.  All helpful feedback on that, so thank you all.

The requests that led to my trying this batch wanted a very strong chamomile
influence, so I went very strong.  40 Twinings teabags, steeped for 7 minutes.

The first stage was fairly typical, and at 1.018 I racked to secondary with
1/2 tsp of yeast nutrient.  Within 8 hours, it took off again like
gangbusters.  It was still going strong a week later, so I knew it would be
dry.  When I finally got a chance to stabilize it, it was at 1.001 or slightly
less.

Naturally I tasted it again, and I noticed what I can only describe as a
"soapy" mouthfeel.

The original batch included the teabags as noted above, 15 lbs light
wildflower honey, yeast nutrient, and Lalvin D-47.  No acid blend, or anything
else.  I've used this honey, yeast and nutrient in the past with no such
effect, so I'm laying blame on the chamomile.

Is this the kind of thing I can address with acid blend?

What effect will clarifying the mead have on this?

Thank you all again in advance.

Lou
