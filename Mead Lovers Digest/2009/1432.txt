Is this the kind of thing I can address with acid blend? What effect will
clarifying the mead have on this?"

Lou,
I don' know if this is relevant but, as I recall, you used Lalvin D-47.
I used that yeast religiously for a couple of seasons on the "advice of
experts".  EVERY SINGLE BATCH had a very waxy flavor to it.  Not sure if
that's at all like your "soapy notes" but I don't use that yeast anymore.
To each his own.

Hope this helps.

With regard to the Chamomile question, I have had similar results as Ste=
ven. I made my chamomile tea the same way and used a whole box of tea (m=
aybe 20 bags). I had blended lemon and jasmine as well. It turned out wi=
th a soapy mouthfeel. I still have bottles of it. Every time I have trie=
d it over the past year and a half, It hasn't changed. I agree with Loui=
s in that the acid won't fix it. Sometimes bad batches just get made. I =
think you made one. I haven't been able to fix mine. I've tried sweeteni=
ng it as well, helps a little but still not a pleasant mouthfeel. =
