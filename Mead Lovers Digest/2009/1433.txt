Hi all,

Been recently interested in the history of GRUIT herbal beers/meads.
More info at http://www.gruitale.com

I can across it listening to an interview with Stephen Harrod Buhner, author
of "Sacred and Herbal Healing Beers - Secrets of Ancient Fermentation

Have the book on order, and I believe there are some Herbal Mead recipes
there as well.

I was thinking of trying a gallon of GRUIT mead with Yarrow, Myrica gale and
Bog Labrador Tea. Wonder if anyone has made something like it?

My plan would be to make a tea out of ~ 1/4 oz (actually 5-6 g) of each herb
(maybe steeping the Yarrow flower in the cooling water to avoid driving off
the volatiles) for the Primary fermentation, and then steeping a muslin bag
with another 1/4 oz or so in the secondary if the flavoring isn't too
interesting after primary.

Amounts based on general rule of 2 oz/ 5 gallons of beer..but it is often
hard to determine if this is FRESH or DRIED herb which has another factor of
about 3 for error.

Also perusing Sir Kenelm Digby's Closet and seeing that every herb under the
sun was tossed into the old Meaths, so I can't see how this can go TOO far
wrong...heh. Famous last words...

Any experiences or advice?

Thanks!
Bob
