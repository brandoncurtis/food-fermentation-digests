Wow! Thanks for all the great advice and anecdotes for my Gruit
project! I did get Buhner's book..and after perusing it, decided I
would ALSO like to try a Heather mead...So I guess I will be ordering
Heather tips along with the other herbs.

I've tried to preserve attribution in the replies below, but please
accept my apologies if I screwed something up:

I've seen that reported for Yarrow. I think I will try to make some
Yarrow tea and test my reaction to it. Since the stuff will largely be
for my own consumption and for a few other adventurous types, I'll at
least test my own susceptibility to the Yarrow reaction.

Care to share your recipe, or just herb concentrations just so I can
get a ballpark figure for STRONG. I will probably go with some other
advice downthread about testing some Tea in proportion to the final
concentration as a guide.  I'd also be interested in your particular
'ritual use'. Feel free to contact me by direct email if you would
prefer. I admit that I was drawn to the topic by BOTH historical and
visionary contexts.

Good advice! I was planning on trying some herb tea made from these
individually and collectively to be sure that I didn't find them
totally unpalatable in that form..but I should mimic as closely as
possible the final concentration in the must for tasting. I'm sure
there may be some differences with alcohol and fermentation, but I
will definitely do this.

THANKS for reprinting your recipe!  What was the Final Gravity? IF it
finished sweet, I'm guessing around 1.02-1.03 or something? Somewhere
around 7-8% ABV?  Been torn myself as to whether to go with a wine
yeast and start at relatively high gravity for a 14-15% ABV, or start
lower and use an Ale Yeast for a more 'beer-like' alcohol content.

That could describe some of the more 'standard' meads that have come
out of my basement... :-)

Another good source of information on
gruit are a series of postings by Adam
Larsen on the Hist-Brewing digest.  Go
here:

http://www.pbm.com/pipermail/hist-brewing/2000/author.html#6174

Scroll down to near the bottom of the author
listings and you'll see his posts.  There was a
compilation of his posts at this link:

 http://sca_brew.homestead.com/Gruit.html.

but unfortunately it seems to be down.

Although Steve Buhner's book "Sacred and
Herbal Healing Beers" has gotten a lot of
attention, at times he seems to take a somewhat
reckless approach to the use of medicinal herbs.
Be sure to research his recipes carefully.

Another good source is Cindy Renfrow's book,
"A Sip Through Time."  In additon to recipes for
old ales, wines, beers, etc., there is also an herbal
glossary, with herbs to be used with caution marked
with an '*'.

Cindy's book is available at her website:

http://www.thousandeggs.com/sip.html

It's also a good idea to be cautious with herbal
mixtures if you're on medications of any kind.
Some medications will have interractions with
certain herbs so again, use with caution.

Hi everyone,

Mead Day is this Saturday; register your site today!
http://www.beertown.org/apps/mead/mead_reg.aspx

Also, this is a heads-up that I have improved the recipe a bit, so if
you printed it out prior to yesterday you might want to compare it with
the recipe now posted
(http://www.beertown.org/events/meadday/recipe.html).  Highlights of the
changes include upping the number of yeast packages to use to 2, if you
don't want to make a yeast starter; including the recipe for a yeast
starter, if you want to go that way instead; and removing the
carbonation option in the Bottling section and replacing it with
information on how to use a stabilizer to keep this a still mead.

Have a great time making and sharing mead with others this weekend!

Cheers,
        Janis

Is vitamin B1 suitable either as a yeast energizer, or as a supplement to
yeast nutrients ?

If so, how many crushed tablets per gallon ?

Thanks in anticipation
