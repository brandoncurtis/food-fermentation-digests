My brew partner and I made a tasty rhodomel.  The notes are here:

> 2 - Are dry or fresh petals better/stronger tasting

We used rose petals that were picked fresh and frozen for later.  We
used a measuring cup to determine that we had 3 1/2 quarts of petals.

> 3 - Does the color of the petal make a difference in the taste?

It might, they do smell differently.  We used a variety of roses.

I have started adding French Oak late in the secondary and like
the result. My question is about American Oak.  Somewhere (which
means I don't recall where) I read or heard negative comments
about the flavor effect of aging with American Oak.  Does anyone
have experience using both?

Thanks for your help, I plan on purchasing that book when I get paid
next week. I made a mead a long time ago when I was 16. It wasn't bad,
but now I want to do it in a more orthodox method without the guess
work and with better equipment.

By the way, I am trying to go through the archives. I have compiled PDF
files of each year, so if anyone is interested email me.
thanks
Peter

Same way one would measure a pint of berries or beer, fill a pint
container (2 cups) full of petals ( I would pack them tight).

> 2 - Are dry or fresh petals better/stronger tasting

  I would use fresh petals, picked early in the morning, before any of
the oils evaporate.

> 3 - Does the color of the petal make a difference in the taste?

It would make more of a difference in the color of the finished product.
BUT -- if the petals of one color are more fragrant that the petals of
a different color, use the more fragrant ones

In response to one of Leo's questions, namely:
> 3 - Does the color of the petal make a difference in the taste?

Not particularly but the variety of rose makes a difference.  There are
roses whose scents are variously described as sweet, fruity, musk, damask,
old-rose, tea, citrus, violet, etc.  Some are elegant and seem suited to
mead.  Others are strong in a sort of grandma's-bath-powder way, and while
they -might- work in a mead (I don't know), it doesn't seem like a good
choice.

Suggestion:  Spend an hour walking around the candidate roses, sniffing
the blooms and then going back to compare, to see if the scents of
different roses seem like they'd harmonize.

It's probably obvious that you don't want roses which have been sprayed
recently.  It's also worth checking how they've been grown, as there are
"systemic" pesticides used with roses.  These may be applied at the roots
rather than being sprayed on, but they enter the entire plant.  Since
roses aren't considered a culinary plant, information may be scarce.
