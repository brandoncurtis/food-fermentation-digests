>From the winemaking side of things the simple answer is French oak gives you
vanilla flavors and American gives you "spice".? It gets more subtle with
toast level, etc. but this is why you tend to see things like American oak
with a Zinfandel and French oak with a Chardonnay.? When in doubt - underoak!

I have started adding French Oak late in the secondary and like
the result. My question is about American Oak.  Somewhere (which
means I don't recall where) I read or heard negative comments
about the flavor effect of aging with American Oak.  Does anyone
have experience using both?

I've been making mead for some time and have never used Oak. I have been
kicking around the idea as of late but do not know when to add it. So.What
is the optimal time frame to add oak and for how long?
