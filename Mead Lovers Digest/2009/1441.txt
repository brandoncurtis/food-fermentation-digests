Toma,

Add it once you're at the bulk aging stage.  Barrels are fussy and
expensive, but a cup of oak beads added to a 5 gallon batch of mead
during aging will give up their essence while your mead ages, and will
be left behind when you rack.  I vastly prefer French oak and a light or
medium toast. I'm not terribly fond of American oak or higher toast
levels unless the beverage is very heavy, and most meads are not.

I've got to agree with Dave from the digest your question appeared in:
It's best to start low and adjust up as you make other batches.  Over
oaked anything is not pleasant.  The spouse and I have a code word when
we're at a winery which either hides flaws or a mediocre wine under a
heavy dose of oak:  "Plank."  It's the kind of wine that might have been
good, had they not decided to soak a 2x4 in it.  Over time oak character
does tend to lessen and blend better, but that just begs the question:
Why are you serving this wine to me now, when it can not possibly be
considered to be ready to consume?

Cheers,
Ken Taborek
