Subject: Potassium Hydroxide (KOH)
From: MeadGuild@aol.com

At the AHA meeting this year, Kristen England, Ph.D. presented the results
of his work using Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) to keep the pH of Mead above
3.3 and, thus, decreasing the amount needed for aging.

I tried this with a Raspberry honey Traditional Mead using the pH UP that
i used for hydroponics.  My results do not deserve comment.

Buying KOH has not been easy as most suppliers will not ship to
individuals.  But I found one - _www.DudaDiesal.com_
(http://www.DudaDiesal.com) .  It
arrived today and it will be used on a batch of a Traditional Clover
honey.  If it works, I plan to used it on several batches in the next three
months.

Best regards,

Dick

Corry asked for suggestions about his?5 gallons of alcohol hot mead.??The
time answer is probably best.? However,?you could also?try a small sample
(e.g. 1/2 oz) with a drop or two of glycerine (food grade available at
most?beer and wine supply shops).? This increases mouth feel and would
probably make the alcohol less prominent.? If it does what you want by
the small taster, scale up to the 5 gallons, adjusted to taste.

Your 'Basic Plan' for your 'first mead in years' sounds fine EXCEPT:

3 pounds of black raspberries probably won't be enough. I would start with
a minimum of 6 pounds, then, after it settles down again, taste and decide
whether or not to add more fruit............Kevin in South Jersey(USA)

Assuming that the 160 degrees is for the honey and water, but not the
yeast starter, then it sounds very good to me.  I would estimate the
finished melomel to reach about 12% ABV.  The black raspberries should
be a very good addition IMHO.
