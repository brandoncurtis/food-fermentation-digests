Thank you for the response Deborah.  I used Three Olive Vodka in the
airlock, just the straight stuff.  From what I could tell, no fruit
flies.  There aren't that many here in the Spokane area as it's very
dry.  I think I've only seen 3 in the 4+ years I've lived in this
house.  I also had the carboys down in the basement where it was dry
and cool.  I have been tasting the bottle I set aside in the fridge
now and again, and it seems to be getting better...though it could
frankly just be my memory.  I was wondering if adding a small portion
of diluted honey to each bottle might help cut the vinegar taste.
It's not horrible, but it's not very good to drink at this point
either.  It makes me think of what people label in the movies as 3rd
world swill...but drinkable.  I will have to try the extra honey on
the bottle I have in the fridge and see if it helps.  I will let you
know.  Any other input from someone that might have had the same issue
would be great.  I still don't know what I did wrong that killed it
other than the unexpected aeration during racking.

Thanks.

It is with great pleasure that I can announce the results of the 5th Annual
Valhalla The Meading of Life mead only competition!  Valhalla was held on
October 17th at Iron Hill Brewery & Restaurant in West Chester, PA.  My
appologies in the delay for these results but there were issues posting to
the web site.

We had 79 entries from around the country competing in 6 judging categories.
Congratulations to Jim Powell for his Best of Show winning Black Currant
Melomel!  For complete results, please visit our website
http://www.valhalla-mead.com.  Score sheets, ribbons and prizes should go
out within the next day or two.

I also want to thank all the judges and stewards for giving their time on
Sat. and our generous prize sponsors.  Without these people, Valhalla would
not be possible.

Finally, I want to give a special thank you to Larry Horwitz and the entire
staff at Iron Hill Brewery & Restaurant for hosting us.  Their generosity
towards home brewers and mead makers is unmatched and greatly appreciated.

Christopher Clair,
2009 Valhalla Organizer

HelloI have the finished my bottling my Raspberry Mead. one straight and
one with a little extra raspberry honey added to it.  Not bad.  I like
the sweetened one better.  I have also made raspberry-vanilla liqueur and
raspberry elixir.  I figure I can do more experimenting as I drink it.
My question is: What is a good temporature to store all these things at.
would a wine cooler be good, or room temporature or what?  The have been
in my bedroom closet which stays at about 68 to 70 degrees.  But now I
want to store them for a longer period of time.

Thank you

Joe Kuhl
