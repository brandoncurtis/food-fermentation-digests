Hi all,

I started my first mead last Wednesday (11/11/09), and I have 2 questions
about the normal rate at which I should expect it to release CO2. It is a
5-gallon batch of traditional mead with about 15.5 lbs of wildflower honey
from a hobbyist beekeeper near Keyser, WV.

I pitched two 5-gram packets of dry Lalvin 71b-1122 (Narbonne) yeast at
about 11:30pm. I put the bucket in my basement, which is uncommonly warm at
about 72-74F. When I got up for work the next morning, at about 7am, the
airlock was already bubbling at an estimated rate of 30-40 bubbles per
minute (about once every 2 seconds). That evening, about 22-23 hours after
pitching the yeast, it was bubbling easily 90-100 times per minute. My first
question is: is it normal for fermentation to be so robust so early? If
that?s not normal, is it just that I pitched two packets of yeast, or should
I be concerned? I was expecting to see some action within 24 hours, not 8.

My second question relates to the period of time that I should expect
fermentation to continue. I have read that it takes about two weeks for
fermentation to slow down enough that I should rack the mead. How frequently
should bubbles be rising when it?s time to rack? They have already slowed
(as of 11/15/09) to about 30 per minute.

Thanks in advance for your input!

If anybody has noticed how slowly digests are coming out (like almost 3
weeks since the last one!), I'll point out that digests only appear when
there is enough material to send one.  In this case there still wasn't
enough material, but I don't want to leave somebody hanging when he needs
help.

I don't create the digest.  It's yours.  I just handle the mechanics.
