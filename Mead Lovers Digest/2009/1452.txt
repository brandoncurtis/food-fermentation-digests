 I got a 5 gallon pail of blueberry honey a couple years ago that wassolid
 crystallized.
 I propped it up on a plastic crate, put a frame of something on top (i
forget exactly what) that overhung and left some head space over the
bucket. I put a small light bulb (15 watt or so?) in the crate below and
draped a large blanket over the whole thing. In a few days, the honey was
completely liquid.
