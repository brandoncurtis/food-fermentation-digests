I regularly have 55 gallon drums that have solidified especially if I
leave them over the winter in the warehouse. I built a 'hot box' that I
pum heat from the heating system into to raise the temp up. It takes
days to a a week or two to melt it.

I have used crystallized honey.  It might be a little more work to get it to
dissolve, but not too much more than getting liquid honey to dissolve. As for
measuring by weight, I think you will still be in the same ballpark. However,
measuring the gravity of your must is more important than the the weight
of the honey. When using honey in bulk (liquid or crystallized), I just
keep adding it and mixing it until I hit my desired starting gravity.

The pitfall of using crystallized honey is that the concentration of water
is no longer uniform. Part of the crystallized honey might end up with
enough moisture for wild yeast or spoilage organisms to take over. If the
honey smells alright, I would go ahead and use it, but you might want to
add a dose of sulfite to take care of any potential, unwanted organisms
before adding your yeast.
