Subject: caramelizing honey

Has anyone tried caramelizing honey? In brewing caramelizing is done to
increase the sweetness and body of a beer as the caramelized maltose can
not be metabolized by the yeast. Aside from caramelizing during the
malting process, it is also achieved by long extended boils of the wort.
I know that boiling the honey for that long would kill most of the aroma
and much of the subtle flavor but I was thinking of just boiling a small
amount of must and adding it to an already fermenting batch. My goal is
to add sweetness that can not be fermented by only honey, and any extra
body would just be a bonus.

Just FYI..... I have been making mead for over 17 years; I made plenty
of sweet meads. I've used stabilizers, lower alcohol yeast strains, and
the feed it till it dies method. I just thought this might be an
interesting project and if anyone has tried it please let me know.

Hi,

anyone compared the Bennell nutrient regimen (2 to 3 X the Fermaid K rate
+ go-ferm at rehydration; see: www.littlefatwino.com/bennellmead.html )
vs the Scott labs regimen ( Fermaid + DAP as for a low YAN wine must;
Goferm at rehydration) ?
Thnaks,
