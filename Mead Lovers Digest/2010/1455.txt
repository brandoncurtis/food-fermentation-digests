You might try caramelizing just some honey in a nonstick pan or
kettle.  It'd be faster and use a lot less energy.

Please keep us posted on your experimentation, I'm very interested to
see what you come up with.

Hey Matt,

You've been making mead since well before I was even introduced to it, so I
doubt I can tell you much you don't already know ...

Except that you might be thinking of "bochet" mead.  This is made by "burning"
the honey, which I think only actually burns a small amount of it, but
caramelizes the rest.  The resulting mead has distinct roasted marshmallow
aroma and flavor.  The difference is that a bochet "burns" the whole quantity
of honey and doesn't produce any unfermentable sugars as far as I know.

Google those two words and you'll get plenty of hits.  Include "Charlie
Papazian" and you should get a link to an article Charlie wrote in the last
couple years about a tasting he was invited to that included some 60 year old
meads, one of which was a Bochet.

I haven't actually tried this yet, but it sounds like it would make a nice
desert beer too.  All these ideas, so little time ...

If you do try this, regardless of the ratio of carmelized/raw honey you use,
please post your results to the list.  I'm sure I'm not the only one that
would love to hear it.

Cheers!
Lou

This, AFAIK, is the goal and procedure that led to the development
of Porter.  Of course, if you could relax the rigor of the all-honey
limitation, ordinary cane or beet sugar would serve as a base for
the caramel.  And maltodextrin would probably give a lighter-colored
product.

Great idea,  Matt.  One of my many fears is burning honey.  So a double
boiler may be appropriate.  I'm thinking 1.5 lbs in a quart.

Hi Matt,

I just recently made a 1G "burnt" mead.  I took a few pounds of honey and
boiled it in a stock pot on the stove for about 15 minutes.  It had kind of
a nasty acrid smell, but the taste of the honey was good, kind of like
marshmallows.  It hasn't been too long since I did this, so I haven't tasted
it yet, but I have been putting updates on my blog (www.letsmakemead.com)
and have some more info on there. I have racked once, and probably will be
tasting very soon.  I wanted to try a small amount before I did a larger
batch.
The honey flavor isn't so subtle, but it is very interesting now.

Give it a shot with a smaller batch & see what you think!

Matt

I am thinking of trying to make a cyzer, well maybe and apple cider with
honey.  I have a recipe, but at this time of year the only apple juice I
can get is bottled that has had sulfites added to it,as a preservative.
It is from a local apple orchard and they put out good stuff.  I was just
wondering about the sufited juice, if it would affect the fermentation
process adversely.  I know that most of the recipes I have found call for
sulfiting the fresh apple juice.  I have never used sulfite before and
was wondering if having it in a stored juice would be any different that
putting it in fresh juice?  In the fresh juice it says you have to wait
24 hours before pitching the yeast.  So should the apple juice be put in
the carboy and then rest for 24 hours before pitching?

Hope to hear back.

While it is certainly my responsibility to keep
my eye on the ball, did I miss the announcement
of Meadllenium here on mead-list@talisman?  The
time of year somehow reminded me this afternoon
but, alas, it is now too late to enter.

Good luck to all who did!

Has anyone every tried using molasses in making mead. I have seen in some
recipies to add corn syrup to mead if you want a sweeter mead. has anyone
tried using this?
