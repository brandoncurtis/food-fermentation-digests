I tried adding some molasses to a batch of cider for additional
sweetening.  It was not a good idea, and I hadn't added all that much.
I think it may be the iron in molasses that causes some of the problem,
as I have heard of iron problems in other fermenting contexts.  After
several months, it may be fit for cooking and marinating.

My one gallon batch of Joe's only lasted a month or so after bottling.
So I have started a three gallon batch for family fans of the recipe.
Following advice on this list and other forums, I decided to increase
the water and honey and raisins (nutrition) proportionally, but the
oranges and spices by half. Some people mentioned the spices becoming
overwhelming in larger batches if increased proportionally. It started
bubbling well within 4 hours and is at a nice steady pace.  We'll see if
this batch lasts a few months!

I tried molasses in a cyser.
Pulling up my notes: 6 oz of light molasses & 4 oz of honey in a gallon.

It was nice, I'd use more molasses next time. (!)
Note it was light molasses (Grandma's brand) not blackstrap. And I haven't
repeated it cause there were cysers that I liked better (lemon spice,
raspberry, cherry, and cinnamon to name a few).

I too will add a recommendation against using molasses in mead. Many years
ago I made a recipe from the AMA called Leather Nun Mead Stout.  (That's
the American Mead Association - not the doctors association)
For one gallon, it used 3.5 pounds dark honey and 1/4 cup black strap
molasses.  I scaled it up to a five gallon batch. I remember the mead being
too dry and bitter while lacking a good body. I didn't particularly like it
and found it couldn't compare in quality to my other meads.  A little bit of
molasses might be OK if you are brewing a braggot and it certainly is
appropriate in porter and historic stouts. I use it as the base when making
non alcoholic root beer. Keep in mind that there are several grades of
molasses and treacle.  I think the dark blackstrap is too strong for brewing
and find light molasses is less overbearing in brewing beer.  I'm  able to
purchase an organic, dark and flavorful molasses at Whole Foods.  It's made
in Paraguay.  Molasses is full of byproducts from refining sugar  and is very
high in iron and potassium.  Perhaps the iron contributes to  the strange
fermented taste. I like molasses with my baked beans and a hot toddy  made
with a tablespoon or two in warm milk with some ginger.

The comments about the burnt and unpleasant tastes associated with Molasses
prompted me to add a comment about using Maple Syrup as a fermentable...

My highest award winning Mead (2nd place Open Mead in the 2009 Mazer's
Cup--87 overall points) was a Maple Syrup and honey mead.  My warning goes
to making sure it's sweet enough!

Maple syrup has that very woody taste, but its sweetness balances it nicely
when you pour it on your pancakes.  But when you ferment out the sugar in
it, you're left with a very harsh woody liquid.  When my friend sampled some
of the young batch, she referred to it as "drinking tree bark."  It was very
unpleasant to say the least!

But when I expanded the batch from 3 to 5 gallons by adding a gallon of
honey and a gallon of water, the finished product at 1.039 was as smooth as
silk!  I auctioned off two bottles of my Maple Mead to help a friend who
needed surgery and raises over $300!

Back sweetening has now become one of my standard practices, even though I
prefer slightly drier meads.  Most of my pagan friends who beg me for mead
have sweeter palates, so I brew toward that.

Moral of the story, be careful with your Maple, and kick it back up a few
notches on the sweetness ladder if you brew with it!

Happy Mead making!

Subject: Honey Prices Level Off In 2009

As of January 2009, honey prices looked to continue their 2008 advance. By
December, however, honey was still selling at January prices - zero change
for all seven prices that I track. More here:

http://www.washingtonwinemaker.com/blog/2010/01/25/honey-prices-unexpectedly-fla
t-in-2009/

There are rumblings that production fell enough to cause shortages - and
price increases - this winter. I don't know if there's anything to this (and
I haven't seen movement in the prices I track yet), but the USDA honey
report will be out soon, and hopefully it will shed some light.

The purpose I am shooting for with the caramelization process is to make
caramelans. I do not know if these are considered dextrins but they do
look like it to me.

    * Caramelans (C_24 H_36 O_18 )
    * Caramelens (C_36 H_50 O_25 )
    * Caramelins (C_125 H_188 O_80 ) (www.food-info.net)

I assume these high molecular weight compounds  will not be fermentable.
These should increase the body of the mead and also change the flavor
and I hope sweetness. I was hoping to get some feedback from people who
have tried it. I do NOT want burnt sugars as that would IMHO have a
negative impact on flavor.

I plan to take it to a medium caramel stage but it is hard to know what
temp that will be due to the mixed sugars in the honey.

There are plenty of amino acids in honey. From what I have read you can
get melanoidins from the lysine in honey  I thought caramelens would be
a better place to start.
