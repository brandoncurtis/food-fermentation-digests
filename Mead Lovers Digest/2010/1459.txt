It's good to break that habit, or to deliberately fool yourself and
hide cases or six-packs. Otherwise you never know what the good stuff
might have aged into - which is often but not always even better
stuff. I hardly even bother to open meads within the first couple of
years - one comes to regret that later on when they get really good,
and you only have 3 bottles left.

Generally, I find that good sanitation leads to no problems with old
stuff, including old stuff that some(I must suppose people with poor
sanitation) claim isn't high enough alcohol, etc. to "last that
long". I envy you a decent cellar, which can only improve your odds.
Nothing in there that won't make you spit it right out (or toss it as
soon as you open it) is going to insidiously poison you, from
everything I understand.

I still have a few bottles of the 1996 batch. Well, it was bottled in
96, might have been brewed in early 95. Records a bit sketchy. It was
really nice for about a year after being bottled, then it got weird
(no honey flavor at all, some bitterness) for about 4 years, then it
got great (honey flavor came back from wherever it was hiding in the
chemistry, bitter left) and has pretty much stayed there. Dry
sparkling non-stabilized live yeast in bottles sort of stuff. No
fancy nutrients, etc. either - honey water yeast (an ale yeast, as I
recall.)

As a less extreme example, I have a (beer) mild (actually a couple of
them, though one is near-gone) which is nigh onto 18 months old - and
this is stuff which the worriers are sure has to be drunk right up
quick since it's very low alcohol (3% or so). It's better than ever.
Old age is not a problem, mostly.

Sanitation being equal, I can't see any reason for fruit or tannins
to make a big difference. If adding the fruit involves a lower degree
of sanitation, you're off into the same area that the "au naturel"
cider folks play in - "will the wild beasties smile upon me, or do
something awful in my brew?"

On second thought, that old stuff is certain poison - ship it here
and I'll dispose of it properly for you ;^0)

I haven't made a maple mead but I have fermented maple syrup.  While this
isn't really a mead because there is no honey in it, (maple wine?),
fermented maple syrup is excellent.   Grade B maple syrup has more flavor
than the more expensive grade A.   Buy in bulk at some whole foods stores.
1/2 syrup, 1/2 water and some yeast nutrient with a basic ale, wine or mead
yeast.   Start out with 1/2 syrup to 1 or 1.5 parts water then add syrup as
the fermentation is underway.   Let this age for a year or so.  The maple
flavor isn't prominent but there are wonderful sherry notes.
