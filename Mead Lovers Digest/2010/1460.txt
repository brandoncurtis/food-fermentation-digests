In following the question & reply about if meads/wines are harmful to the
human body if they are consumed after having aged awhile; is consuming
them while the yeast is still active harmful to your body in any way?
I am a brand new honey wine brewer & have just ordered a hydrometer, so
have been consuming racked mead that is 3 mos. old.   Will this upset the
yeast count in my own entrails?
Thanks for your help.

I've agreed to supply mead for a "Handfasting" (Wedding) in which there
will be about
100 people.  How much mead should I plan and bringing?
