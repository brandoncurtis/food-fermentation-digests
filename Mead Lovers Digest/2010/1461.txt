From my vast and extensive experience drinking unfiltered beers, the
worst that will happen to you is that you will be gassy for a day or two.

Dr. Jim,
I have now made mead for 5 weddings of about that size (3 of my kids and
2 of their friends).  For all the weddings, I have provided a 6 or 7 oz
clear crown capped bottle for each person attending (with custom labels
and shrink top) and often open mead in carafes for the tables ???when
allowed by the venue, along with enough bottles for the wedding couple
to have anniversary bottles for the future celebrations.  This generally
takes about 12 to 15 gallons.

There are a lot of quack doctors who claim yeast is some kind of universal
cause of disease and inferment. They make up fancy names like "The Candida
Connection" to market their nonsense.
The reality is, yeast, when eaten, is pretty harmless stuff. Unless you're
immunodeficient or have major digestive issues the sulfuric acid in your
stomach will kill it off. Even then, your gut flora and fauna does a pretty
good job of keeping other things from taking hold. Your immune system is
actually the last line of defense against food born pathogens and if it
can't handle yeast, you probably have an active HIV infection. I've heard
teetotalers claim that yeast can keep fermenting in your stomach and
intestines, but simple chemistry shows this to be a flat out lie.

Don't take my word for it though. Quackcast is a podcast by an infectious
disease doctor. In the podcast he dives deep into specific quack medicine
claims and does very through research into the topics. Episode 24, "The
Yeast Dis Connection" covers this with a considerable dose of humor in a way
that makes the data very accessible to the layperson. WARNING: Watch out for
his truly vile pun about the homebrewer.

I am notorious for molesting young  Meads, i.e., 2 to 4 months old.
Active yeast, if there was any, has  had no ill effect on me.

Some people  will not drink any, some will stop after one, and
some  will drink a lot.  My general rule for Mead and wine is
to  plan on 6 fl oz per  person.  A major exception to  this rule
is plan on 8 fl oz per person for  Irish and Greek weddings. So
you're looking at 5 to 6-1/2  gallons.

If you can get me invited, I  will make sure you will not have
to haul and store left  overs.

I am headed out to San Diego at the end of the month, and I am looking for
any where that has mead.  I am from PA, so we can't even have it shipped
to us.  I have not tried much commercial mead, and hope I can find some
in CA when I am out.  Any thoughts are appreciated!
