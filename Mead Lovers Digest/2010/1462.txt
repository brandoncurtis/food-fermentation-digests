I'm originally from the States but I'm currently spending a few months
in Australia. I'd like to bring back a bit of Australian honey to make
a gallon or two of mead once I get back home. Does anyone know of some
good varietals of honey I may be able to find here which wouldn't be
available in the states? Also does anyone know if it is a problem to
get multiple pounds of honey back into the States through customs?
Thanks everyone

Kevin Kurkul

The acid in your stomach is Hydrochloric acid NOT sulfuric acid... doesn't
change the conclusion. :-)
