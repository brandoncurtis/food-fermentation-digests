OK, just got back my scores from the mazer cup, and one comment I saw on a
cyser left me with a question.  What kind of options are there for making a
cyser (or mead in general) more "complex"?   My instinct is to look into
blending 2 or more cysers from different apples, but what else?  ML
Fermentation, spices, a distinct honey (eg, something like a sourwood)?

Dick gave me my best score, reminded me to come back to this list and pose
the question - thanks for the feedback, I appreciate it.
