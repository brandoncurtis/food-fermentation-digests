Brent,

Complexity is very subjective, but you can help along the judging by
using a few ingredients which may help them come to the conclusion that
your mead is complex.  If the competition uses BJCP standards, a Cyser
in most categories can only be apple juice and sugar (and not even
honey!).  This leaves little options for complexity other than a careful
selection of your apples.  Selecting those meant for cider rather than
table apples is your best bet.  These typically have a stronger acid
component, and quite frankly will be far, far superior to a cider/cyser
made using canned frozen juice or grocery apples.  If you have a chamber
of commerce local to you, call or visit and ask about farmers markets or
pick your own farms.  I have found chambers of commerce to be very eager
to assist me in finding sources for fresh fruits for mead making.  You
didn't list your recipe, but you can't go wrong with fresh ingredients,
and you'll find your cider apples here before you'll ever see them in a
grocery store.  If you can't get the ingredients fresh, you may still
find better or at least more diverse cider than you might find in a grocery.

If you're in a looser category, a pound of raisins will add a lot of
mouthfeel, which may be judged as complexity.  Mixing juices (as in a
28B) can also increase complexity.  A small portion of white grape adds
mouthfeel and complexity. A 28C can take advantage of the permissibility
of added sugars to add complexity via sugar source.  Adding some honey,
beet sugar, and brown sugar will make a more interesting drink than one
which uses only cane sugar.  And a 28D opens up the world of spices to you.

I recommend "Making the best apple cider" by Annie Proulx.  It is a
short (30 pages) and probably still cheap (my copy reads $3.95 US with a
copyright of 1980) resource for much information on making apple cider.
And from cider to cyser is just a small step, the basic information is
just as valuable for either beverage.

Cheers,
Ken

I'll take on cyser specifically.
Try blending multiple apples.  See if you can get some tannic apples in the
blend--you can use some crabs as long as they're not too acidic.  Tannins
add complexity and mouth-feel (texture, body).

Be careful with choice of honey.  I would say "no" to really distinctive
honeys since they might fight with the apple character.  OK, give 'em a
try, but think carefully before you actually enter one.

Spices, frankly, are trite.  Unless you're exceedingly careful, and use a
light touch, you end up with the "OH WOW APPLE PIE" effect.  Some folks
like this.  I don't; more to the point I regard it as out of character
for a cyser.  You should have enough to work with, given the variables of
honey source and apple variety.

Mainly, experiment with blends of apples.  Take a page from the cider
folks:  Blending is the norm; "varietal" ciders are unusual and often
out-of-balance.  Use different varieties to get the acid, tannin, and
aromatic characters.

[All that said, our top cyser was a Kingston Black varietal!  BUT...
KB is an unusual apple, not readily available, and not easy to work
with.]

OK, just got back my scores from the mazer cup, and one comment I saw on a
cyser left me with a question.  What kind of options are there for making a
cyser (or mead in general) more "complex"?   My instinct is to look into
blending 2 or more cysers from different apples, but what else?  ML
Fermentation, spices, a distinct honey (eg, something like a sourwood)?

Dick gave me my best score, reminded me to come back to this list and pose
the question - thanks for the feedback, I appreciate it.
