Brent

That is incorrect.  By definition a cyser is 50% apple juice and 50%
honey plus or minus.

An apple juice fermented with sugar is just a crappy stronger cider.

Hi Folks,

I've made several batches now and even though I started to rack two or
three times, my mead still seems to be cloudy. Should I be filtering it
somehow?

Thanks!

That's way wrong, so I quizzed Ken about it off-list.  He was thinking
of the rules for cider, not cyser--just a slip-up.

Cyser is indeed made with apple juice and honey.

I agree that cider varieties will give a far better result.  Even apples
which are regarded as "multipurpose" with one of the traditional purposes
being cider (such as Gravenstein or Macintosh) will be better than usual
table fruit.

However, I disagree with the generalization that cider apples have a
stronger acid component.  Normal practice in cider blending uses low
acid fruit as well as "normal" acid level; truly high-acid cider fruit
is not common.  What cider fruit does offer is tannins, which really
give cider body as well as this elusive "complexity" we're after.
