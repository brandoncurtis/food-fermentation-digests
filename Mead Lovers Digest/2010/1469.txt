If you're subscribed to this Digest from either juno.com or netzero.com:
Your ISP has rejected the digest twice this year.  Unfortunately the
reason given for rejection is gibberish--a string of 88 hex digits--and
there's nothing I can do about it.  If it keeps happening I'll just have
to unsubscribe you all...so keep an eye out if you start missing digests.
Sorry.

Reverse Osmosis
Nathan Boettcher asked about commercial use of reverse osmosis for mead.
Jilbert Winery in Valley View, Ohio uses it twice on their mead - once
before fermentation and a second time to remove the yeast when it gets to
the point they want to stop fermentation; and then sells the mead/honey
wine immediately.  In my opinion, the mead tastes very clean with few
faults and compares favorably with most commercial meads - but is a bit
thin and young.  Although good now, I have a bottle or two aging to see
what happens to it in a year or two.

If you are referring to something along the lines of a
Buon Vino Mini or Super Jet system, you???re looking at
a high dollar cost.
Before doing that I suggest you try Super-Klear which should
be $2 per packet.  If that doesn???t work, look into an inline
filter which can run  between $5 and $60.

I don't enter mine in any competitions, so I don't pay attention to rules,
but my cyser is made from nothing but fresh pressed apple juice from my
neighbor's trees (enough to fill a 5 gallon carboy minus the honey), and a
gallon of honey from local hives, plus whatever yeast seems interesting at
the time.

We ended up drinking most of our 2008 bottling at last winter solstice. Very
strong and tasted like essence of apples. Now we're drinking the "apple ale"
we made last fall using nothing but more fresh pressed juice and Nottingham
ale yeast, no sweetener added. Very dry and refreshing.
