That would be an interesting idea. Reverse osmosis filtration separates
out from bulk wine a "permeate" stream which is nearly pure
water/alcohol, containing no color or flavors. This can then be
distilled inline and the resulting water or alcohol added back to the
wine to increase or decrease the alcohol content.

I don't think that they are really using reverse osmosis but perhaps a
modified cross-flow filtration or possibly a bulk lees filtration and
then inline a .45 or .2 micron absolute filtration (ultra-filtration).

But then again maybe I'm wrong. Not to brag or anything but I probably
have the most advanced filtration system in the 'mead industry.
