Sorry for the confusion.  You are absolutly correct.  Jilbert Winery in
Valley View, Ohio does NOT use reverse osmosis (which would only provide the
water/alcohol - but uses ultrafiltration using ultrafiltration cartridges.

I have used both bentonite and Sparkloid to clear meads.  Either are added
to a small amount of water and brought to a boil.  This apparently ionizes
the solution and when added to your mead will attract the particles causing
the cloudiness and drop to the bottom.  I have never experienced any altered
taste using these.

I buy R/O filtered from dispensers commonly found at supermarkets.  It
usually costs $.25 to $.40 per gallon. I buy it in plastic five gallon water
containers also usually available at supermarkets or Wally World for a
reasonable price.  I have never added sanitizer and had no problems.
