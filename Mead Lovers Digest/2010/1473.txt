Hello all,

I am new to this forum, and to mead in general.  As I live near many
excellent honey (and fruit) producers, I thought I should
start experimenting with mead.  I can buy good local beer and good wine, but
so far have had trouble finding a good supply of mead.  In a not too distant
future I hope to have bees of my own and I think that starting to learn the
trade now can only make my future endeavors more exciting.  However, I need
to turn my better half on to mead so I write to all of you for a request of
a simple mead recipe which tastes good early without much ageing.  I plan on
building a cellar and producing batches in the future to age,
and experiment with, but for now I need to get her on board. For her to be
on board, I need something tasty to give her ASAP.  I know age is almost
always recommended, but from the readings I have done I know some taste
better when 'fresh' then others.  I am aware that the world of mead is large
and of differing opinions, but I ask despite the risk of disagreement.  I
should note that I have read a few books, but I have yet to produce anything
myself (like a true academic); however, I am willing to make anything that
may turn her onto mead (Traditional, Melomel, or Meddyglyn are all welcome
but minimalist approach to additives is desired).  Taste is key, clarity and
color are seconds for now.

Thank you,
Graham

Practical:  (my definition) affordable, effective, and not so much trouble
you won't want to use it.

An Ultrafiltration system could be mighty pricey compared to a couple
hundred bucks for a Flow-Jet.
Especially if the cartridges aren't cleanable for reuse.

If there's an affordable system out there anywhere I'd love to try it, even
if I only used it for my water....
