Hi all

I've got a cyser that is about 14-16 months old (I do know exactly, but
that info is on a different computer), that I've just racked. as part
quality assurance, I tried some, and it is *VERY* tart. I know you are
all going to say let it age, but this being my first ever Mead type
drink (I've been brewing beer for ages and always wanted to get into
mead, but this is my first venture), and I'm so eager to get into it.

What can I do to mellow it out a bit? I'm in the UK so will probably not
have access to a lot of stuff you Americans can get.

Thanks in advance.

On a side note, In the last 2 - 3 years of reading everything I can find
on mead, I keep coming across Dick and his child-bride, I just want to
say I'm a big fan. Keep up the good work LOL

  I've been making mead that is ready to drink in three to six months.
It is with the "Joe's Ancient Orange" recipe. It is easy to do, bottles
straight from the primary and is very drinkable, although it turns out
fairly sweet, but not syrupy. To counter the sweetness, I changed from
oranges to red raspberries, up the spices and add a bit of cayenne pepper.
  It may be a simple recipe, but I took third place with it in Meadlennium a
couple years ago. And my wife prefers it to most commercial meads (they tend
to be syrupy).

I've made the "Joe's Ancient Orange" with great success and love the idea of
trying it with raspberries.

Do you just drop them in or do you smoosh them a bit first?
How much fruit per gallon would you suggest?

I am not familiar with Petter Bennell's presentation.
Where can I find it?

Also I would sincerely appreciate it if someone would e-mail me
Kris England's 2009 AHA Mead Presentation as it is either no longer
on the AHA web site or I just can't locate it.
