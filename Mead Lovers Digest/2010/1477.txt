All the suggestions so far for back sweetening are good, although I'd
add that pasteurizing the mead to deactivate the remaining yeast,
would be an option that I'd use, since i don't do "chemicals".

On the other hand, there is also the consideration of possible
bacterial infection which could have turned the mead to vinegar.  If
this is the case, the flavor and aroma of acedic acid should be
apparent.

If this is the case, then the batch is lost for mead, and should make
a good salad dressing.

I hope that's not the case, but something to consider.

Max,

Eileen gives the same advice I would, but with one missing piece.  You
do not want to use sorbate without also sulfiting.  Fermentation in the
presence of sorbate produces an off flavor that will ruin your mead.
Sorbate only prevents yeast propagation, so any live yeast can begin to
act upon any added sugars immediately.  The sulfite will shock it
sufficiently that this will not be an issue.

re: Craig's advice, I'd go with a sugar (Craig suggests brown sugar, but
honey or even cane sugar would be my preference) before adding apple
juice.  Apple juice is fairly acidic, and this is what you are looking
to counter in your mead.

If you go with any of the suggestions to add bicarbonate, which will
indeed reduce the acid level, do be sure to mix the powder with water
before adding it to the mead.  Any powder added directly to your mead
will allow any dissolved CO2 to come out of solution, and this can be an
explosive (i.e. mead gushing out of the top of your carboy) experience.


Regards,
Ken

My first cyser was very harsh and 'rocket-fuelly' until it had aged about a
full year after bottling, when it turned yummy
