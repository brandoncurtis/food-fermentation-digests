Hi,

a matter of maths: honey is roughly 80 brix. maple syrup about 66 B. since
slight variations are possible, make the must a bit stronger and dilute to
the target brix.

Hi Tim,

I've made maple mead (Acerglyn) that came out very good.  I used 1 gallon each
by volume of light wildflower honey and grade A maple syrup (for some reason I
couldn't come by the grade B - which would be much better).  This fermented
out pretty strong.  OG was around 1.118 (seemed a little lower than I expected
with all that honey and maple) and FG was 1.008.  After 4 months I filtered it
with rough pads and bottled it.  If you think oak makes a woody character, try
removing all the sugar from a gallon of maple syrup and see what you get.
Still, it was wonderful.  A bit like chewing on a maple twig, but very good.
It's been in the bottle for just 5 months, and at last tasting (2 months ago)
it was still a little woody, but clearly mellowing out.

I've given a few of these out and admonished the recipients not to even
*think* about it until they had pumpkin pie on the plate after Thanksgiving
dinner - or better yet, Christmas dinner.  That hasn't stopped several of them
from sucking it down like maple sugar candy and asking for more.  The only
thing I can think of to change is to force carbonate it.  I think the flavor
profile would have been amazing in a sparkling mead.

I did not add any acid blend, seasoning, or adjuncts of any kind, nor did I
back sweeten this one.  I pitched Lalvin D-47, which I think was a good
choice.

There are lots of suggestions online, but I've not tried anything beyond a
basic acerglyn yet.  It's possible this would do well with a few raisins
tossed in, or even dates, but I think next time I'm just going to carbonate
half the batch.  If it comes out half as good as I expect, I'll probably start
carbonating it as a matter of course.

Good luck.
Lou

Hi Tim,

I am new to mead but while reading and learning as much as I could about the
craft I stumbled across this website and made note (as I am from southern
Ontario, a great spot for maple syrup.)

Apparently he won an award for it.

I once made a maple Mead, and the maple aspect was a little strong at
around 2parts honey to 1 part syrup. I like my mead sweet, but that one
was exceptionally so, even more than most dessert . My Dagorhir group
christened it "Stylgar's Who Needs Pancakes" Sadly, all of my notes
have disappeared, so the exact recipe has vanished. I have thought
about making another, but so far haven't done this. I'd probably use
3parts honey to one part syrup.
