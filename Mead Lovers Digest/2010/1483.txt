Since the mushrooms are only for flavor, contribute negligible if any
fermentable sugars, and the resulting mead (technically closer to a
metheglin) is intended primarily for cooking, I think you'd be better
off making a regular batch of mead and when you wanted some MushMeth just
reconstitute/steep the mushrooms in however much mead.  Because drying is
one of my primary preservation methods for my large garden, I reconstitute
dried products in spirits all the time and is a relatively common restaurant
practice.  That way you get your MushMeth as needed, get to still use the
mushrooms in cooking that you would have otherwise tossed during racking,
*and* have the rest of the bottle of (unadulterated) mead to drink with
the dinner.  In fact, I'd question whether there would be much difference
between the "instant" MushMeth and the brewed version other than that the
instant would have a "brighter" mushroom flavor analogous to dry-hopping
with beer.  But, such is the stuff of experimentation and innovation.

Having brewed for several years now, I confess that I enjoy the
experimentation side of brewing more than the production/consumption side.
One piece of hard-earned advice with your MushMeth and most if not all
"experiments": go small on the first batch(es) rather than face the very
discouraging possibility/eventuality of having to somehow dispose of
larger quantities.  When I first started, I had some glorious failures
(read, "not with my mouth") that I learned a lot from but could have
learned the same lesson less expensively (both monetarily and emotionally)
with smaller batches.  I'm in recovery now, and my mistakes, thanks in no
small part to this forum, are less in volume, severity & frequency. ;-)

Warm Regards

But which mushroom would have a large impact on the outcome.
I'd think to try Lepista irina, which has a lilac / iris smell to it and a
delicate flavor. But you won't find it in any stores anywhere, just in fairy
rings in the woods. :)
I have some dried - depends on how big of a batch you're making.

Our colleague Robert Lewis <mazerrob@gmail.com> wrote, in summary,
that he ferments on the sediment of his last batch.
This is a procedure many beer brewers follow with success. I have declined
to even try it simply because I have only made one Mead I thought worthy
of entering into a competition - and that Mead became bottle infected.
He continues with a discussion about a Mulberry Melomel and a desire
to try a Mushroom Mead.
I??m not a big fan of Mulberries because of their tartness.  However,
I love Mushrooms.  The only problem I perceive is too much mushroom
resulting in a Mead that tastes like mushroom soup.
He continues with ??I did a capsumel (hot pepper) mead once, and was kinda
disappointed???.
The problem with hot peppers is the threshold between the flavor and
the heat.  As my childbride continues to tell me ??You can always add
more, but not less??.  So the trick is to add a little at a time until
you have the flavor you want.
He ends with ??I have had vodka with pepper corns... any thoughts???
Vodka infused with peppers sounds great to me.  It helps if you
crush the peppers.  One thing I have learned about Vodka is that
unless you plan to drink it neat, buy the least expensive Vodka
you can find.  But make sure you like the taste before adding itto a
Mead.

OK...this ought to get at least a 6 on the Esoterica scale...

Anybody know how to prep angelica seed for use in a metheglin?

The "seeds" as they come off the flower-head are maybe 5x8 mm and flat,
but that's mostly a husk.  The kernel (if you will) of the seed is about
1x4 mm.  Some experimentation suggests that it's a good idea to get rid
of the husk since it will only contribute uninteresting or even harsh
flavors.  But how to do this?

What I've done so far is to rub the seeds between my hands to break up the
husk and free the kernel, then place it all in a flat pan and blow on it
to disperse the light husk material.  It's like the classic "separating
the wheat from the chaff" idea, but the kernels here are really small so
it isn't efficient.  I can only get away with it because I've got a lot of
seed and can afford the losses.

So, any better ideas?  (MUCH preferably from someone who's done it)
