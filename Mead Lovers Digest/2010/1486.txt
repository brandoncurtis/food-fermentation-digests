How high a % would I need to get to to be reasonably sure the mead would
be good in 15 years?
Thanks,
Steve

And I remember someone putting the question out some years ago if the
digest should be shut down now that we've reached issue 1000.  "What
else is there to say?"

This issue seems to answer:  "We've only begun to start a bubblin'..." :-)

Thanks everyone!

*Who has a copy of the (historically)  oldest Mead recipe?  I have one from
the 15th Century, found online from a British aristocrat.  Would love to
have some more to tuck away in our recipe book.   sammy.wight@gmail.com
thank you.*

Since mead weighs approx. 8 lbs per gallon, I'd think lifting 80 lbs is
indeed an issue even if you're in buff condition.  It's a shortcut to a
lifelong back problem!

 I have given away most of my one-gallon glass (harder to find these days)

Ay??  Fruit juice still comes in gallon jugs especially at organic markets.
I have had no problems finding as many as I need.  A good quicky cider can
be made by removing the cap from a gallon jug of Knudeson's, tossing in a
packet of yeast and placing a fermentation lock.  This transates to a cyser
with the addition of honey with the overflow going into a quart jug.
