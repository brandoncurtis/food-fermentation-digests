Big caveat:  Do not use a pectic enzyme late in the process as it  produces
methanol as a by-product.  Better to live with a hazy melomel than  go
blind!

This is why I no longer use corked bottles.  I began some time ago enjoying
Steinlager in 750 ml crown cap bottles and Grolsch in bale cap bottles.  I
now have several cases of each and use them to bottle all my meads.

I too have run batches to "completion", watching the last carboy like a hawk
for bubbles through the lock, taking serial S.G. readings until they are
unchanging for a month and even adding potassium sorbate at the final
racking.  All too often the result has been bottle rockets, a sticky mess
and a highly annoyed spouse.  Now, if it recarbonates, I enjoy the
unexpected sparkling mead with clean walls and floors!

Meant to address this point...a few digests back, Mark Ottenberg noted:

I don't recall contemplating shutting the digest down at 1000!  But
certainly it would have been a matter to consider.  And that was seven and
a half years ago.

Yes, a lot has been said...BUT (for better AND worse) a lot has been said
wrong, or not-quite-right, or "huh?!?".  So we keep learning and fixing our
mistakes, and the ingredients and process get more predictable.  I think
- -that- is why the digest keeps muddling along.  It's not just helping the
new folks; it's correcting our own misunderstandings and filling in the
gaps.

As for how long this thing will keep going...I dunno, but unless something
goes way-wrong, I figure I'm good 'til issue 2000.  There WILL need to be
some modernization!  (OK, those of you running Windows 98, just calm down!)
