I have recently been introduced to Ice Wines and love them but this got me
to thinking and reading up on the subject with an eye towards mead
production.  Is there such a thing as Ice Mead?  I read of a alternate
method to induce artificial cold to the grapes/fruit and then press them as
this reduces the loss one has if the natural freeze comes to late.  What if
one were to press the fruit first and then freeze the resultant juice to
remove the water content and them ferment would not this obtain the same
desired result?  The reason I ask is the only fruit press I have is a very
old, small one that I fear would break trying to crush frozen fruit.

I am unaware of any laws in either Australia or Indonesia
pertaining to shipping of alcohol.  But if it is illegal, I'm
unaware of anyone will to break the law.

When I was in Australia in 2007, I stopped at these Meaderies
and can testify to their high quality:

Bartholomews         bartholomewsmeadery.com.au
Maxwell  Winery      maxwellwines.com.au
Daringa  Cellars      www.denniswines.com.au
Chateau Dorrien      _www.chateaudorrien.com.au/main.html_
(http://www.chateaudorrien.com.au/main.html)
I also stopped at Walk About Meadery in Victoria, but I don't
have a URL for them.  I met Ian Dunton in NSW only to learn
that he had closed his Meadery a few years earlier. Due to car
problems, I didn't stop at Dingo Creek Meadery in Queensland

               I am just getting started in the making of Mead.  I have as
yet to buy any of the equipment.  I was hoping that I could get some advice
on the equipment and a good starting recipe for a novas to make.  Are using
bottles that have the metal and plastic mechanical closing cape good for
making mead?  Next question I live in Colorado, can anyone suggest any
places that make mead that I could visit and get advice.  My email is
suunsu@gmail.com.  Your help will be greatly appreciated.
