Hi,

I'm a n00b when it comes to brewing mead; I've done 4 batches now and
all seem excellent thusfar; I've brewed beer though for about 2 years
and have brewed wine on and off for the last 15-ish.

Anyway, here's my question...

My first batch was a sweet cherry melomel(12 lbs of honey for a 5 gallon
batch) on which I used Wyeast 1084. 2 months go by and fermentation
stopped cold. After waiting another month to see if it'd restart, I
figured it must have attenuated so I mixed together another 6lbs of
honey and some yeast nutrient/energizer, and then added a bit of oxygen
to make sure it started. And it did NOTHING for another month. At that
point I didn't want it to be THAT sweet so I figured that the poor
yeasties took a bad hit and that they'd need a re-up and I'd just gotten
this 20-23% alcohol yeast and wanted to give it a try just to see what
it'd do. Well, it took off again and 10 days later petered out yet once
again(the yeast instructions say this is about the length of a good brew
for it). I let it sit another week and it did nothing so I measured the
FG(1.008) and decided to stabilize it.

Now comes the fun part. Today I used my spectrometer on the mead and it
reads that I have 28% alcohol. How is that even possible? I assume that
the additional honey/nutrient could have done all the work in addition
to the yeast but 28%!?!?!?!

My only other thought on this is that maybe my spectrometer doesn't work
correctly with the mead(I know it gives horrible readings for my beer).

Anyone know why mine would be so high? I know if it's a legit reading
I'm going to need to sweeten this a bit, or drink in very small
quantities...

Thanks for any insights and I hope to contribute as much as I learn...
