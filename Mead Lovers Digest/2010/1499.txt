It is verry possible. I have 15 gallons of mead that I made using White Labs
WLP-099 High Gravity Ale Yeast. My vinometer's scale stops at 25%, but if it
has a line for 26%, that's where the reading stops every time.

I expect this mead to take a long while, 2 years minimum before it ages and
mellows some. Right now, I call it jet fuel. It's a very high octane brew!

Hi Eric,

All of your questions are answered with the same advice.  Use your
hydrometer more often.  The hydrometer will tell you the OG, the FG, the
% alcohol, and a little algebra will allow you to calculate for
secondary honey additions as as well.  It will also answer questions you
might have about what is going on with your mead.  So instead of
"waiting another month to see if it'd  restart" and "figuring that it
attenuated", you take a gravity reading and then you know if there are
any remaining sugars for the yeast to work on.  I see that you took a
gravity reading at the end, I just don't understand why you didn't use
that tool to help you understand the progress of your mead rather than
working off of guesses and adding this or that based upon that guesswork.

Cheers,
Ken

Hello Eric,

A couple of things in response to your post/query.

First, welcome to madness.

Just to help you with the terminology, mead is not "brewed".  Brewing
is an extraction process, and although there are types of mead that
can use extraction, the cherry melomel you described, and indeed most
meads do not use such a process.

The proper term for mead is "making".

Now to your question of alcohol content.  I did the math as best I
could, based on the limited information that you gave, and I see no
reason to expect that your reading is off by much.

It would help to have the initial hydrometer reading (you did take
such a reading?), but my rough calculations gave an initial gravity of
4 gallons of water and a gallon and a half of honey to be in the
neighborhood of 1.26.  A final gravity of 1.008 should yeild an
alcohol content in the 26% range, the additional sugar from the cherry
juice making up the difference.

How is this possible you ask?  Simple. alcohol tolerance is based on
several factors, and when it comes right down to it, yeast is gonna do
what it's gonna do.

BTW, in my experience, there is no substitute for the hydrometer,
whether making mead, wine or beer.

It gives you a real point of reference to know where things are, as
well as where they came from.  Part of the procdess is linear, and as
such requires these coordinates to make any sense of where one is.

Best,

Hi,

are there competitions in canada beside those of the amateur winemakers
in which mead is grouped with country wines ?

otherwise the closest will be mead free or die, i guess

Are you using a spreadsheet to compensate the readings for the alcohol
content in the must?  That could be your problem right there.  Ethanol has a
different refractive index than water so it throws off the readings.  You
can find these online with Google, you just need to put in the
pre-fermentation reading to have the calculations work correctly.  That
being said, an alcohol content of 28% is pretty high, but within the range
of the super yeasts you reference if the conditions are right.

I suspect the actual situation is that the super yeast got up around 22-23%
and the error you are not accounting for in the calculation too you the rest
of the way to 28%.

Just to be sure we've got the numbers right, you've now got a 5.5 gallon
(roughly) batch?  I'm figuring at the nominal 12 lb per gallon of honey,
so you started with 4 gal liquid and 1 gal honey, then later added another
half-gallon of honey.  How much cherry, and was it fruit or juice?

So it fermented down to 1.008 (after some trials and tribulations, snipped)
and...

OK, we need to know what you -really- used for your measurement.  It
wasn't a spectrometer.  It might be a hydrometer--a long glass bulb in
a tall skinny jar that you fill with liquid and see how high it floats.
Or it might be a refractometer--a gadget where you put a drop of liquid
on a small glass plate, close a cover, and look through an eyepiece to
a calibrated scale.  It might be a vinometer--a thin glass tube into
which liquid is drawn by capillary action, with a scale alongside.  Or
it could be something else entirely.

Trouble is, the hydrometer won't help you figure alcohol unless you have
an initial reading.  The refractometer doesn't give a direct reading on
a liquid containing both alcohol and sugar; you need an initial reading
plus some calculations to use the reading.  The vinometer won't give
accurate readings when there's sugar present.

Could it be 28%?  Simple answer is "no".  You didn't say how much cherry or
cherry-juice you used, but even if you used just juice and honey (no water)
it wouldn't get you quite that high.

Give us some more details and we'll see what we can figure out.
