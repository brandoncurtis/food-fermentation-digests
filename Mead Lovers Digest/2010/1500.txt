  (several answers to multiple responses)

Your vinometer is useless unless the wine is absolutely dry. Period.

You can use a hydrometer but ideally you need one that is graduated with
very fine graduations. I use four that are broken down into three major
ranges and on lower range that is much more accurate.  Also, a
hydrometer won't give you an accurate reading at 20% abv either as they
are not calibrated for solutions with alcohol either.

I also use an ebulliometer for final alcohol measurement as well a lab
distillation setup for much more accurate determination. If you have
$20-30K kicking around you can get yourself an Anton-Paar setup like

Regarding the correct terminology, brewing, making etc are all okay. I
don't think there is a proper word and certainly I wouldn't complain if
anyone asked me if I 'brew' 'vint' or 'make' mead.  If I use extract to
brew a braggot, I'm not 'extracting' so is it brewing or making?

Either way who cares? Just keep on making mead or variants of mead and
have fun.
