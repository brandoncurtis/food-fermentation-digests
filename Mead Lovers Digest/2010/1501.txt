I did and forgot to write my readings down; this happens a lot since I'm
often interrupted when brewing.

It would not, however, have answered my questions after I added the
extra honey/nutrient/oxygen and the yeast didn't restart as I would have
expected, would it.

Again, I get interrupted a LOT...I tend to remember the readings I get
in a general sense and then simply look for a visual change on the
hydrometer.

Actually, that's not entirely correct...

"Brewing specifically refers to the process of steeping, such as with
making tea, sake and soy sauce. Wine and cider technically aren't
brewed, rather vinted, as the entire fruit is pressed, and then the
liquid extracted. Mead isn't technically brewed, as the honey is used
entirely, as opposed to being steeped in water."

....but I do see "making" used in titles of books so maybe it is more
appropriate.

That's about right. I don't remember the initial reading but it seems
about right.

This is possible..That's why I was questioning.

5 gallon *total*. Around 1 gallon honey(12 lbs), a quart of sweet cherry
puree and filled to around 4.5 gallons(at the time I was afraid I might
get overflow like I get from my beer). Racked it and added honey, which
brought it to almost exactly 5 gallons.

Yeah, it was a refractometer..couldn't think of the name for the life of
me the day I wrote that.

Wow, those are expensive, even the one I could find on ebay was
$1500...but they're something to consider at least.
