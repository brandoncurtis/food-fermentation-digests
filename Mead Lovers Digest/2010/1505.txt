I've gotten my hands on a large quantity of saffron so (of course) I 
want to make a saffron mead. The recipes I've found say "Since saffron 
is so expensive, I only used..." and "Since saffron is so expensive, I 
combined it with..." Anyone have a clue on how much I should use in a 5 
gallon batch, expense being not an issue here?

I judged at Meadllennium 2010 and will do so again next month.  The meads
I judged were above average and the Judges with whom I judged were at or
above what you would expect at an AHA Regional.  I had the privilege of
judging with Ron Bach who lived up to his reputation of being an excellent
judge of Meads.  My childbride and I will arrive on Friday in the hope
of some early judging.
