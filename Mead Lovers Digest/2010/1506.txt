I too came upon a large quantity of saffron in a bazaar in the middle east
several years ago.   So I could afford to use it in a hobby.   While I
didn't use it in mead I did make a clone of Dogfish Head's Midas Touch that
used malt, honey, wine must and saffron.    My approach, and what I'd do if
I were going to make a saffron mead would be to make a very small quantity,
perhaps make three  1 cup meads at the strength you plan and use different
amounts of saffron in each.   Then taste them and scale appropriately.

Eileen Uchima asked about saffron into mead if price was not a consideration.
I see you are in IL, but I have a fellow SAAZ club member in Akron Ohio
who has asked exactly the same question.  Has anyone tried making a high
saffron mead?

One thing about saffron is that if you use too much it can give a
metallic taste to your mead, and it may require a little ageing to get
past that. I made a fabulous mead from Randy Mosher's book "Radical
Brewing", named Call Me Al pp269-70, I think it calls for 1/2 gram or
so max. Not much is needed! Below is a link to a similar one I found
on the internet, probably where he got the base from as it uses all
the same ingredients, but he jazzed it up a bit. His is a great book,
if you don't have it already.
