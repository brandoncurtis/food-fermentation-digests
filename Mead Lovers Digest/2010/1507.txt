One thing about saffron -- for best results in getting its flavor, you
need to steep it in boiling-hot water. This is in contrast to most other
herbs, where the flavor is muted or destroyed by heat.

Important Update:

Due to multiple resource issues, we are unable to hold Meadllennium in
January.  We will update this website and other forums if we decide to
reschedule for 2011.  Thank you for your past support and keep making
great mead!
