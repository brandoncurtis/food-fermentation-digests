I have been making mead for a number of years now using the same recipe.
Normally the must is cloudy but clears after a few weeks.
Lately, it has stayed cloudy.
I have used old honey and new honey with the same results, but not all the
time.
Any suggestions as to what the cloudiness is and how to clear it up?
I do not use chemicals in my mead and so want a natural way to clear it.
I have tried running it through a wine filter, all that happened was the
quality of flavour dropped.

Edward
