Are you sanitizing your equipment?  I don't use chemicals in my mead either
but I do sanitize every last item and I keep the whole process sanitized.
I wash my hands in the sanitizer solution all during the brewing process
and all equipment.

I have been making mead for a number of years now using the same recipe.
Normally the must is cloudy but clears after a few weeks.
Lately, it has stayed cloudy.
I have used old honey and new honey with the same results, but not all the
time.
Any suggestions as to what the cloudiness is and how to clear it up?
I do not use chemicals in my mead and so want a natural way to clear it.
I have tried running it through a wine filter, all that happened was the
quality of flavour dropped.

I am of a similar mind-set where I don't want to use chemicals if I don't
have to.  Usually the haze is particulate from the fermentation process.
I've usually had good success with sticking the whole thing in the
refrigerator and letting it sit for a few days.  This usually shocks it
and all the particulate drops out.  At that point, rack it off the lees.

The only thing of caution is that once it warms back up, it can potentially
restart fermenting.  Best to let it sit for a few days after monitoring
your SG.  If that remains constant, your certain that fermentation is done,
then you can bottle it.

Thanks,
Talon.

How long have you waited for the mead to clear? I suspect you are on
a much faster timeline than I usually work with for meads, given that
you mention "normally clearing in a few weeks" - have you let it sit
for 3, 6 or 12 months to see if it clears? That's about as "natural"
as you can get. I forget if the batch I need to bottle is a year or
two years old at this point...

If it tastes good, an opaque container does nicely with all forms of
haze, if you don't like to look at the haze. Your wine-filter
experience would seem to indicate that you do prioritize taste over
appearance (though I'm not clear from what you write if the haze
remained, while the flavor degraded, or if the haze cleared up and
the flavor degraded.)

The recipe & procedure you are using might provide more insight as to
"what it could be" - ie, a plain "honey water yeast" mead is not
subject to pectin haze, but meads with fruits are... while yeast is
always available as a potential haze source, especially if the yeast
in question flocculates poorly.

I'd be curious to know what your recipe was, what kinds of opportunity
for haze there were.

Also, I can't pass up a chance to ask for recipes - I'm about due to
make something in the cellar : )

Cool it to 35-40 degrees F.  Put the fermenter in an old 'fridge with the
shelves removed, or outside, if it is above freezing or any place else
(unheated room, basement, etc.)that is cool enough. This usually causes all
sediment to drop to the bottom...
