I use glass carbouys, which I rinse in a strong bleach solution before
and after each racking and rinse until no bleach smell remains. Same for
the racking syphon tube.

Edward,

Something else occurs to me.  Bentonite and Sparkloid are not
(IMHO)chemicals like sulfite or sodium benzoate.  They are finely powdered
clay that when used according to the label instructions create a suspension
to add to the must.  For whatever reason (I'm a nurse, Jim, not a
physicist!)the particles seem to have an ionic charge or something that
attract whatever is making the must hazy.  The particles thereby become
heavier and drop to the bottom.  Subsequent rackings leave all that behind
and you have a clear mead.

I too do not like to add chemicals to my must.  I use sulfite to sanitize
but do not add extra to my mead. I do not believe there is a chemical
reaction involved in the bentonite/Sparkloid process so the must is not
changed and nothing of the mineral is left behind at bottling.  Neither me
nor my mead-drinking friends have noticed any difference in taste between
batches that cleared by themselves or by use of the mineral.

BTW, by not using chemicals like Sorbistat I occasionally get the pleasant
surprise of a sparkling mead even though I have left the must in the
fermenter for months and racked it into (I thought) submission.
