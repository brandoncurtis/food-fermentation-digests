Apologies to all who may have been waiting for this announcement - I got
a bit sidetracked with other obligations.  But - better late than never!

The Mazer Cup International 2011 - Mead Only Competition - Call for Entries

April 01 & 02, 2011, Boulder, Colorado

The Mazer Cup International is a BJCP & AHA sanctioned mead-only competition
open to all home meadmakers.

After a tremendously successful competition in 2010, and great feedback
from the Mazer Cup founding fathers, Ken Schramm, Dan McConnell and
Mike O'Brien, Gotmead.com is totally motivated to present the Mazer Cup
International 2011. We will do our best to continue the tradition of the
original competition, and work to make it the best competition possible. We
are committed to bringing the best judges available to Boulder, Colorado
from North America, Europe and wherever else mead is held in high regard.

This year we will continue the tradition of the original Mazer Cup by
awarding hand-crafted mazers to the winners of our home competition. Our
distinctive medals for the commercial winners have already become a coveted
achievement in the commercial mead making industry.

The MCI competition staff and Got Mead are working hard to present a
world-class home and commercial mead competition the weekend of April 1-2,
2011, in Boulder, Colorado. The Mazer Cup International is well on its
