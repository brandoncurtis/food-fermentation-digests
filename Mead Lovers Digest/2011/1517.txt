Subject: One Gallon Batches
From: MeadGuild@aol.com

I have been averse to one gallon batches for a few
reasons, e.g., measuring out the appropriate amount
of yeast, maintaining the pH level, and clarifying.

If you use 2 packets (10g)of yeast in a 5 gal batch,
will 2 grams of yeast in a 1 gal batch be appropriate?

Any ideas on what to do for ph in a 1 gal batch?

For clarification, I'm going to use Bentonite.

I nice thing about 1 gal batches is you can pick'em up
and shake then the first few days.
