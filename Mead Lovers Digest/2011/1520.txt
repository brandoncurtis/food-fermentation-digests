I don't -object- to it, just don't know why you'd do it.  Sure, rouse it
or oxygenate it once at the start (pitching)...but after that, why?
Don't give in to "more is better".  Once you've given the yeast their
initial oxygen, anything they don't use up by the time they switch over
to anaerobic is just that much possible staling.

OK, I may be overreacting there, because I dislike meads that have gone
faux-sherry-like by the time they're bottled...plus I make a lot of
melomels, where excess O2 just shortens the best part of their lifetimes.

Thanks Paul.  I wouldn't say its a burnt match or egg-y taste, more like the
smell I had when the fan belt on my car was loose before I replaced it.  I
have lots of carboys, so I will keep aging away.


M. Graham Clark had a slight burnt rubber taste in his meads.

Carl, I would be interested in  the results of your expariment, but to be
honest I don't do any boil.  I am on well water so there is no chlorine.  If
its a cold day I will warm a bit of water up to get the honey moving, but I
try to minimize heat on my honey.  There could be trace microbes, but like I
said I have never had a problem with beer, even when I only do partial
boils.  I haven't tried any other mead yet at my new place, but I will in
the next month or so and see if its a pattern.

A "burnt rubber" smell is one of the descriptors applied to yeast

Thanks Spencer, I will do some reading on autolysis once I am done marking
final exams and have a little free time.  Hopefully I can avoid it in the
future, if this is the case.  I don't think I left it on the lees for any
extra amount of time, but maybe I got side tract.  I will check my notes at
home.

Thanks Ken.  I tried the penny trick with no results.  So I didn't think it
was sulfide problem, but maybe its too far gone.  The flavor does seem to
mellow a slight bit with time, so maybe with more time it will go away.

Thanks everyone,

One off aroma and flavor I'm very sensitive to is contributed by the
use of a rubber stopper. It's just horrid. There are now universal
stoppers, made with a different material, which do not give off these
aromas that permeate the mead. Personally, I rarely ever do batches in
less that 3 gallons (mostly 5s) so I always use a carboy cap. It
doesn't cost that much more than a stopper, still well under $5-. And
no, it makes not one bit of difference if your stoppers are "new",
this does not mitigate the damages caused in any way. I know a lot of
folks can't catch this in their meads, but trust me, it's in there!

Cheers,

Deborah

Could someone affiliated with the Mazer Cup competition please post the
results or let us know what happened?  I can't find anything online more
than that, at the official site, the results were intended to be announced
on 4 April.
