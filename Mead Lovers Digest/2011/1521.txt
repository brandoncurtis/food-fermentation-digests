Subject: unwanted effervescence
From: dan@geer.org

I inquired on this phenomenon once before (quite some time ago);
consider this simply a report.

On Jan 31, I bottled a chamomile metheglin.  It had been racked
thrice since fermentation, and was a fourth time 24 hours previously
to bottling.  The second and third had shown no lees whatsoever,
and the color/clarity can only be described as straw/crystalline.
The time from initial ferment to bottling was 23 months.  All tank
time was in glass.  Initial SG was 1.024, final was .094, and that
final SG has been stable for 20 months.  Yeast was D47.  Bottling
temp was 60 F, as was all storage.

Now, 75 days later after bottling, they are effervescing.  When
bottling, I used new bottles and new plastic lines, all of which
got a rinse in Iodaphar a half hour before commmencing.  The corks
were also new, and floating in Iodaphor solution before insertion.

The taste is wonderful and the effervescence charming, except for
it being unwanted and evidently building up.

The reason for my last discussion of this topic was to ask "How is
this possible?"  The answers were largely "You don't know what you
are doing," which while true is irrelevant.  Nevertheless, this
latest batch again raises the question of "How is this possible?"
when sanitation is as good as I can get, the liquid is utterly
clear, everything that touched the product is new, it is two years
plus three rackings away from the active phase, the specific gravity
would imply that there is nothing to ferment, and the ABV (12.9%)
would similarly imply an inhospitable environment for ab initio
yeast growth.

I shall enjoy my effervescence and any answers.

My understanding is that delaying anaerobic fermentation by stirring or
shaking, is because the yeast proliferates more readily and vigorously in
the presence of oxygen, initially.  But of course the more stirring, the
greater the risk of infection.  The trick is to find a balance.  Personally,
I have found that two stirrings over 48 hours, then airlocking to start
the anaerobic fermentation, results in a very vigorous ferment

As to the why, it's because of what I've learned about yeast and their
need for O2.  I'll never claim to be any kind of yeast expert, but what
I've read suggests that the yeast can use and does need O2 additions
after pitching, for a few days, before they go anerobic.  And that any
excess O2 is scrubbed away during the fermentation.  It's only after
fermentation stops that guarding against O2 needs to be vigilant.  It's
been my practice for years to open and stir/blend my meads for a few
days after pitching.  And my ferments are shorter than other mead makers
report, just a week or 10 days, and certainly not the months some folks
have reported.

And as for faux-sherry-like, I can't even get that when I use flor
sherry yeast.  I recently bottled a mead I deliberately allowed to stand
with a dry airlock for months, and which I pitched with flor sherry
yeast.  It was a sort of experimental mead, I called it "kitchen sink
melomel" because I used a lot of different fruits I just happened to
have available.  Some kiwis and honeydew melon left over from breakfast,
a small quantity of blueberries left over from making a pie the night
before, a couple bananas that were getting past their prime that I cut
out the older portions of, and I think that's the list.  The mead turned
out to have a very fresh, punchy flavor, and the non-mead drinker who
helped me bottle it called out the melon before I found my notes.  I've
since had another mead making friend tell me how to encourage a flor
pellicle, which never formed in this mead, but after deliberately
exposing the mead to O2 was surprised that the flavor of this 2002 mead
was as fresh and fruity as it was.  Admittedly, the amount of exchange
available in a still room and through a dry airlock may be trivial, but
after the stern warnings about the negative effects of exposure to O2
I've read about I was surprised.

Cheers,
Ken

This post made my ponder:  Doesn't everyone use carboy caps?

I tend to age my meads and wines for often great periods of time.  I can
claim it's a method, but mostly it is laziness.  Bottling is my least
favorite part of the hobby.  After I'm certain all fermentation is
complete, or if I am transporting (I buy in to my father-in-law's
winemaking crew, and need to move my portion of the wine from NJ to VA),
I'll snap on a carboy cap.  They fit very tightly, so I do not fear O2
exposure, they have never popped off as a stopper with airlock has, they
cannot go dry if not tended, and they are cat-proof (the cats are not
allowed to go into the brewing room, which means that they primarily
want to go into the brewing room...).

Cheers,
Ken

I sanitize the appropriate tubing and an aquarium air stone, connect it to
an oxygen tank, submerge the stone in the must and run it at a brisk bubble
for ten minutes just before pitching a yeast starter.  After that, I
scrupulously protect the must from oxygen--the enemy of alcohol.  I happen
to have access to medical oxygen but a small tank from a welding supplier
with an appropriate regulator works very well and doesn't require a
prescription.  The yeasties just LOVE the oxygen-rich must to start off.

BTY, I almost always use Champaign or Cuvee' yeasts and have never had off
flavors from the yeast.
