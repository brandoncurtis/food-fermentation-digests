I made a clone of Ken Schramm's Heart of Darkness melomel recently and was
wondering what others target for a FG. Mine's finished at 1.005 and needs some
sweetening. If you have made this before and liked the results, what gravity
did you end up bottling?
 Best regards,
Mike Winnie

 RE: Unwanted Effervescence

Dan

Yeast are tough little organisms and just because the solution looks clear,
there can be several hundred per mL floating around.  When you racked the
mead, it picked up some oxygen and that gave the yeast enough of a boost to
get them to ferment that last little bit of sugar.  Now to start an
argument...The only way to be sure that your mead will not continue to
ferment in the bottle is to use some form of sorbate and campden tablets.
This is a double shot that will keep things nice and still.  My process for
sweet meads is to add campden tablets, 24 hour later I sorbate, 24-48 hours
after that I cold crash to 35 C, 5-7 days after that I rack and bottle.
Since I started that I have never had a sparkler.

RE: Oxygenation
Oxygen is a limiting factor to yeast grown and adding it to the must is
allow the yeast to use it for sterol synthesis.  Sterols are required to
keep the yeast cell walls pliant and the yeast healthy.  Pure oxygen is an
easy way to go, but the old carboy shake dance works well too.
