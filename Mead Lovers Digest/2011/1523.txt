Folks,
Is it time to shut down the Mead-Lover's Digest?

In the past, we expected one or two digests a week.  But now, the most
recent article was submitted over seven weeks ago; the last digest came
out almost six weeks ago.

As admin/janitor, it makes little difference to me; the effort involved in
keeping the digest mechanism around is negligible.

BUT I feel it's wrong to hold out the MLD as a potential resource for new
meadmakers, and then not deliver the goods.  There are 12 new subscribers
just since the last digest, who've seen absolutely nothing.  And the
digest content has been falling year-on-year since 2005; last year was
about 1/3 of 2005.  That's quite a drop considering that subscriptions
have been steadily increasing!  We've got just over 1300 subscribers.

I realize that this posting is likely to prod some folks into submitting
articles they've been considering.  If so--fine!  But if it sputters and
dies again after a bit, let's think about whether it's worthwhile.

I also realize that this posting will generate meta-discussion (about the
shut-down question).  Feel free to send that either to the digest itself
or to the admin address mead-request@talisman.com, where I will gather
and summarize.

There have been a few off-list suggestions of how to modernize the MLD, and
I'm open to trying some of them.  But I'd have to get a sense that the
readers actually want this.  The Cider Digest operates just the same as
the MLD, but with 3/4 as many subscribers it has substantially more
traffic.
