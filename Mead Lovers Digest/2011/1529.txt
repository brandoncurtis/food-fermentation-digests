Note that beekeeping is hard work, so with a lot of aging beekeepers
like your former local source leaving the "hobby", there may be an
opportunity near you to work with a beekeeper in exchange for some honey.
You might just find someone who's ready to retire but willing to continue
for a few years--with your help or long enough to get you started.

This is a possible partial answer for younger meadmakers who don't have
much money but have some spare time.

> ... Everyone should have their own bee hive(s) just like a dog or cat!...

As I said, beekeeping is hard work (and usually hot as well).  A super
full of honey is more than a lot of folks can easily lift, let alone
repeatedly lift and carry.

Seems to me that beekeeping is an ideal situation for a community project,
since once you get going you'll likely have enough honey to supply a fair
number of households--even if some of them are making mead.

>...Cider makers seem to all grow their own heirloom/cider apples -

They do?  I mean, we do?
No, not really.  I think many of them -aspire- to do so, but I don't see
that most do until they're getting into quantities approaching small-
scale commercial.

> ...Dick, you make cider, got your

Oh, yes...I have my own trees, plenty for one person to manage.  In fact,
I've really more than I can handle during the spring and fall, so I'd be
daft (moreso than I am!) to add beekeeping to what I'm doing now.  Plus,
there's no shortage of pollinators around here.

Still, what I -might- do in the future is work with a beekeeper to keep
a colony or two here.  So, folks thinking about beekeeping might look at
the flip side of that:  If you don't have a suitable place for hives at
your own home, look around for someone growing bee-pollinated crops.
(That said, an orchard -by-itself- isn't enough for bees, since the
flowering period is too short.  Bees need flower sources through the
spring and summer.)

Subject: Crystalised Honey

Hello, good to see newsletter has survived long enough for me to write
in. My Mrs is a first season bee keeper here in Melbourne Australia
and has had a bumper heist of honey. As she uses organic practice and
raw extraction, a lot of it has crystalised. This makes it harder to
sell but I believe if the crystals are small it is still good for
mead? (I'll let you know in six months). Perhaps those looking for
cheaper honey could ask local beekeepers for crystalised.  Has anyone
had any experience or tips about working with crystalised honey?
Thanks. Pat

Thanks to Mike Higgs for pointing out that the text of Digby ("The Closet
of the Eminently Learned Sir Kenelme Digby, Knight, Opened") is available
via Project Gutenberg...in fact it's apparently been available for more
than five years (?!?!).  This is a real eye-opener for the history of mead
from several centuries ago.  See
http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16441/16441-h/16441-h.htm

I've added this to the FAQ that gets sent to new subscribers.  It will
find its way to the talisman.com/mead page before too long.

Yes, I agree, everyone should have their own Bee Hives (unless you are
one of those allergic to bee stings).  Would help to rebuild the dwindling
colony counts in the U.S. as well.

But, just like making Mead, there's much to learn.  For example, here
in Northern Virginia we have a plant called Mountain Laurel, endangered,
protected, but quite a bit of it around where I live.  When it is in bloom,
hives must be closed up and the bees fed sugar.  Because, honey made
from Mountain Laurel is poisonous.  Yep, poison honey.  (Apparently the
Roman army used to leave jugs of this stuff out for advancing enemies.)
Fortunately the blooming period is short.  But, you have to be aware,
and I'm sure there are those on this list much smarter about this than I am.

Look for a local bee keeping club, usually evident with a display at
your local county fair.  Otherwise, a pretty quiet bunch.  As an aside,
what always amazed me is that bees are shipped through the mail.  Like,
3,000 bees in a small box, carried by your postman.  Can't imagine walking
around with one of those under my arm.

Thanks,
Jim.

> Be careful from where your honey comes ...

Unless something happened while I was sleeping, honey

imported from mainland China is an illegal import
because it is contaminated with God knows what!

Unless you are certain that the honey you are buying
has the blessing of the FDA, do not buy it!

Two needed Commandments:
Thou shall NEVER buy honey from China
    - as far as I know honey from China is still illegal.
Thou shall keep thy our own bees
    - even in the "Land of the damnyankee Snow".

My childbride and I have an agreement that when we move, we
will keep bees.  Our only disagreement is who will be the
beekeeper. ;)  While I expect to lose that argument, I am
certain our out-of-pocket cost will win!
