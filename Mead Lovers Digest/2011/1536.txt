I don't know how many of you are familiar with the Bee Folks here in
Maryland, but apparently they haven't raised their honey prices yet in
response to the low supply because they just sent out an e-mail advising
their customers to buy now before prices go up on Friday.  They have lots of
interesting and unique varieties, such as avocado honey.  Also apparently
some of their bees got into a mix of meadowfoam and maple at the same time,
so they have a limited stock of that honey (apparently a marshmallowy-mapley
taste).

According to some Belgian info
(http://www.wijnkennis.be/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=564,
Dutch language) getting sparkling wine is much easier than it used to be.
It's possible to use a method called "dosage des billes". Adding a dose of
"yeast pills". These "pills" are made of algae with inside sugars and yeast.
These algae containers act like filters and the yeast cells stay inside.
That way the clear wine stays clear.
After this in-bottle fermentation is done, the bottle is turned and the
pills simply roll out into the temporary closing capsule.
My question: does anybody know where to get these pills?
Obviously it's easy to get this info just by writing to the website owners,
but they haven't responded yet.

Subject: Habenero Pepper Mead

Eight years ago Red Savina Habeneros had the highest Scoville heat units
rating.  I planted enough to get almost four pint jars of crushed Habeneros.
 This year I planted 23 Bhut Jolkia plants.  They were planted late and
just started to bloom.  Based on observation, a few of them may not make it

The objective in making a Habenero Mead is to get as much as possible of
the pepper taste with as little as possible of the pepper heat.  It ain't
easy as I've judged Capsicum Meads that were undrinkable even with my
cauterized throat.

Most Meadmakers with whom I've discussed this use fresh peppers rather
than crushed peppers.  I add crushed pepper just before clarification and
would not add whole or minced peppers until then.  On one hand, it's always
trial and error.  OTOH,with crushed peppers, you know how much you added last
time.  Also that way I can engage in Quality Assurance Testing (QAT), i.e.,
drinking from the carboy.  As my childbride says "You can always add
more."

Does anyone else make Hot Pepper Meads?

I have made many ginger meads and honestly, the fact that Eric is
using pounds of ginger is pretty absurd to me (no offense Eric).
Possibly the ginger in beer is much less pronounced than in mead but I
usually use about 2.5 ounces in a 5 gal batch of mead to get a strong
ginger presence.  My advice would be to make a 5 gal batch and split
it into 5 one gallon batches and try different quantities of ginger to
find what works best for you.  Ginger is a very strong spice and if
overused can render your mead undrinkable.  Just my 2 cents.
