Long time reader, first time writer - It's worse than you think Paul -
Some of the commercial "meads" made in the UK are merely cheap bland
wine with sugar and "honey-flavouring", not even real honey! Invariably
this stuff is made for theme events where it is swilled to excess - if
it was real mead those people would have to go to hospital. I've taken
my own mead to some of these events and shown people the difference, but,
like fans of bad lagers, they'd rather swill the rubbish than invest the
time in making the good stuff. Also, my small batch buckwheat has taken 2
years but is superb, thick and treacly. The small batch orange blossom has
delicious fruity tones although, weirdly, it has picked up some carbonation
so it pops and froths when I open the bottle (one even exploded!) but when
I pour it out and drink it, it's completely flat. I used the same dessert
wine yeast in both. I probably woke some yeast up in the racking process.
