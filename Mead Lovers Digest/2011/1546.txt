That's a real shame! The stuff was a bit light but was very very good to
drink. Perhaps they haven't had access to the best honey anymore, as I'd
imagine it was pretty darned good judging from the flowery nature of the
mead.

There's a guy I know with bees here, out on an old  rice terrace. I'm
looking forward to working with it! I'm going to suggest that he plant
wildflowers in the other fallow terrace gardens next year.

Aloha All,
I am a meadmaker and beekeeper who lives on Hawaii Island.  There are no
laws here requiring boiling of honey/mead must nor pasteurization of honey
for sale.  The sale of raw honey is perfectly legal here and happens all of
the time.

Living near thousands of acres of macadamia trees, my girls gather nectar
from macadamia flowers when they are in season.  The honey is somewhat
buttery.  Nutty?  Not that I have ever tasted.  Certainly nothing like the
flavor of macadamia nuts

+1 on the organic honey scam.  Bees forage up to a two mile radius from
the hive. That is over 8,000 acres.  How can anyone certify that every nectar
source within a two mile radius is organic?

Is price your main consideration when purchasing honey?  Consider this:
