IMHO, just because something has an FDA-approved label saying it's organic
doesn't tell me anything. They've allowed so many exceptions that their use
of the word has become meaningless. "Walmart organic", it's known in the
trade, although no one will say that in their marketing literature.

Re:...well, the whole honey thing

Here's a site you all might be interested in:
http://www.truesourcehoney.com/
This is the future of honey for us apiarists, so as consumers you may 
want to be aware of what it means. I suspect there will be more of these 
programs put in place around the globe very soon.
As for organic, ART & Dick covered some excellent ground. There will 
always be someone willing to lie and cheat about their product; that 
doesn't automatically mean everyone will. Yes, anyone used to be able to 
call themselves organic and there was no way to prove it but that is 
changing rapidly. The restrictions in place for organic certification 
now are hard to meet but worthwhile. In 2009, we had a big change to our 
Standards that forced many of the cheats out. Food using the Canada 
Organic label or being sold to other provinces/internationally must meet 
far more stringent requirements than ever before, and I doubt it will 
get any easier. Buffer zones and soil and water tests are just part of 
what it takes to go organic but really, why would you want to go any 
other way?

Cheers,

Continuing the conversation about organic honey, it would be next to 
impossible to attain USDA Organic certification for honey in the USA 
unless located out in western states where there may be enough 
individually controlled acreage that would be needed for controlled bee 
forage without pesticide/herbicide treatments, etc. However, it is 
allowable to use the term "Organic" on labeling for producers selling 
under $5,000.00 per year and assuming they follow the basic organic 
practices and guidelines under USDA regs.  Most Certified Organic honey 
available for sale in the US comes from outside the USA , like 
Australia/New Zealand, etc. I agree that "buyers beware" of anyone using 
the term "organic" and just be sure to do diligence on their practices.

An excellent alternative to USDA organic certification is offered by 
another organization, Certified Naturally Grown (CNG). They have fairly 
strict guidelines laid out and require fellow beekeepers police each 
other through yearly inspections by two other CNG beekeepers. More info 
on this certification program and listings in your area of CNG approved 
apiaries can be found on the website http://www.naturallygrown.org/ . 
This program follows organic practices but with real world practical 
situations taken into account. There are not many CNG listings for good 
reason. It's not easy to manage bees successfully under these strict 
guidelines.
