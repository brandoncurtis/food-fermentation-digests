I really thank you all for your great input.  What I was thinking of when
I asked the question came closer to our brazilian fellow William answer,
I thought about making something with a copper coil going trough boiling
water and then trough cold water for a little time as he explained. (I
made my own distillation device and used copper in it, it conducts heat
great, also destillated a batch of mead that I thought came ugly, and
the destillate came out great! If anyone would like to try to distill,
here is a great site on how to do it and even how to build a device:
www.homedistiller.org) Again, thank you very much for the help, I will
have to consider the change in taste after some experimenting, and maybe
otherwise use the other tecniques mentioned...

I'm hoping that relative increase in alcohol will prevent new fermentation
from starting. There are several pitfalls to avoid in this operation and I'd
appreciate any comments, especially from anyone who has tried a similar
technique.

First off: Freeze distilling is illegal, so I didn't do it. I just happened
to have a pan with mead in my freezer and after pouring off the mead from
the ice I just happen to taste it.
Well, if you search for freeze distillation, you will see a lot of threads
warning for methanol and other drawbacks.
There seems to be a Spanish commercial mead which has been distilled, which
is said to be amazing, but those are obviously controlled environments.
The thing is, that if you remove water from your mead, everything fortifies:
flavor, off-flavor, aroma, faults, sugar, acid, everything. So with this
process you will get a sweeter mead. And also a less balanced mead in my
experience.
Now if you are going to sweeten it, you also dilutes the alcohol. Depending
on the amount of honey you add you might have a re-fermentation on your
hands anyway. At least, you don't have any guarantee, that you don't, unless
you do an in-bottle pasteurization, but that is another thread :)
I would sweeten my mead and wait some time after that to see what happens.
In fact, that's what I did just a few weeks ago.
Cheers.
Wout
