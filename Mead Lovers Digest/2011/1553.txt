I have two problems with freeze distillation.  The first and most
obvious problem is that it is illegal.  Even if you never tell anyone,
you still know you're doing something that???s illegal.
The second problem is simple arithmetic.  To raise the ABV of
a 19 liter batch of 14% Mead to 15%, you have to remove 1.27
liters (~43 fl oz) of water.  [19 - (19 *.14) / .15 = 1.27333. .  . ]
I've been told by lager guys that you have to skim off ice crystals
at least twice a day.  It seems like more work than it???s worth -
especially when you can approximate the same thing by adding
a 750ml bottle of 80 proof Vodka.
I have found that putting a secondary fermentation in a refrigerator
and racking it once the temp of the Mead is down to 5?°C (42?°F),
does a wonderful job of eliminating yeast.

I made my own distillation device and used copper in it, it conducts heat
great, also destillated a batch of mead that I thought came ugly, and
the destillate came out great! If anyone would like to try to distill,
here is a great site on how to do it and even how to build a device:
www.homedistiller.org<http://www.homedistiller.org/>)

I don't understand what this means.

Also, there are only two ways to legally distill alcohol in the U.S.:
Get a Federal Fuel Alcohol permit (about $25.00 last I heard) and use
the product as a motor fuel or get a Federal permit to distill potable
alcohol.  The last is expensive and has stringent and detailed
requirements and ongoing inspection provisions.

A friend got the necessary paperwork to sell some of the mead she had
made and it was incredibly complicated.  In the end, she abandoned the
idea because it just wasn't worth the hassle to sell a few bottles to a
very limited market.  The additional federal requirements for a permit
to distill alcohol go up a quantum level or two.  It might not make
sense if you aren't selling it, but there it is.

What are some of the methods of fining meads?  I made a semisweet mead a
few months ago, and after racking twice, it does not seem to be
clarifying.  It is in a nearly full 5 gallon carboy, in my basement,
about 55 degrees now.  Any suggestions would be helpful.  Thanks, -David
