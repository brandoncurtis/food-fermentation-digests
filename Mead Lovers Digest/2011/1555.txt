I believe Ken was referring to half cup for a 5 gallon batch which will
yield ~ twenty five 750 ml bottles. A half cup is 120 ml which will yield
24 teaspoons. So a teaspoon per 750 ml bottle is on target.

> Can honey be substituted, if so how much?
I'd use honey.  Some people use priming sugar, and I've ever heard of
people using Cooper's Carbonation drops.  Wether or not dextrose is
an acceptable substitute for honey is a question someone else will
have to answer.

> Will yeast still be sufficiently frisky to reactivate after six months?
My suggestion to create a solution half honey and half water.  (A
microwave just a great job of putting the honey into solution).  Then
gently stir your Mead to get yeast back into suspension then rack a
few bottles adding two teaspoons of the solution.  Give the bottles
two weeks and then open one to see if the yeast took the bait.  If
not, rehydrate a small amount of yeast and add it to the next solution.

> PS Are there any fellow mead brewers in Melbourne Australia?
According to pint.com.au/links/homebrewclubs/victoria, there are five
homebrew clubs in and around Melbourne and they all have websites.
They would be a good place to start looking for fellow Meadmakers.
According to pint.com.au/links/homebrewshops/victoria, there are
almost five shops per club.  I've no idea how big these shops are,
but if they sell honey, they'll most likely know a Meadmaker.  It won't
hurt to ask.

There is something to be said for learning and practicing traditional
methods of making just about anything, including eis mead. If all people
wanted was a honey-flavored alcohol boost, I'm sure there are faster ways
than adding alcohol to mead as well. There's nothing wrong with wanting
quick & dirty homebrew, but much satisfaction in carrying on a craft-brewing
tradition, even if it isn't the shortest path.

 I am a relatively new in mead making have been enjoying it for About 5
years. A few digests ago there was some information concerning the use of
Vanilla in Mead.Unfortunately I deleted it an now I need some advise. I
have made a couple batches of very good Raspberry and am now interested
in adding a new twist by including some vanilla. I have an ounce of
Madagascar beans from our local wine making supply outlet but now am a
little nervous as to what amount to use in a 5 gallon batch. I am
thinking it should be added during bulk ageing but would entertain all
suggestions.
As well as my raspberry I have produced some very good Traditional Sweet
mead, Blueberry, Cranberry and an interesting batch of Braggot.
Thanks to all.
