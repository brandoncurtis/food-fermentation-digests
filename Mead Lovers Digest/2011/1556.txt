A few digests ago there was some information concerning the use of Vanilla
in Mead.

Yeah, that was my question. Unfortunately not quite answered, but hey,
experimenting is nice.
You can find the archives on Talisman.com.
Using Google also might help, as I found this info:
Use 1 (read one!) vanilla bean.
Cut open lengthwise.
Cut in pieces of about 1cm (might be omitted).
Put in empty teabag, including the tiny seeds.
Hang in mead.
Taste every day (read *every* day).
Remove teabag when the taste is right. (Mine was a bit too strong after 2
days for my taste and purpose, but wonderful all the same).
I think with above method it's best to add post-fermentation, maybe even
when CO2 has gone, as then you can have a better idea of how it will taste
in the finished product.

My question was about taste development over the years. Not quite your
question, I think. The amount to add is a matter of taste, purpose and
balance with the other ingredients.
Please do share your recipe and tasting notes.

Hope this helps.
Cheers,
Wout.

Hi,

 I have 3 jars of honey that look like some early fermentation took place
(bubbles, none before)

No weird smell.

Do you think I can still use them to make mead ?

 Even tempted to make "natural mead", no yeast addition, maybe no nutrients
( unfiltered, raw honey; still has pollen and stuff)

Or I can always throw in a yeast with killer factor.

Martin
