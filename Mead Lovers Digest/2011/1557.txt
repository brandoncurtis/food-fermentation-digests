I have been adding a teaspoon or so of vanilla extract (real) per every
5 gallons of fermented must when I make fruit meads/melomels. My goal has
been use the vanilla to make the fruit stand out but not so much that the
vanilla is noticeable. Making the addition post fermentation provides some
control. Pre fermentation addition would drive off most of the volatiles
you would want to save.
The right amount of vanilla will really make your berry meads seem more
'berrryish'.
I am pretty sure I posted a strawberry vanilla mead recipe either here
or the bees leees, way back when.

A definite YES.  But if you are correct about having
a early fermentation, you simply need to stop it and
killed the wild yeast that started it.

If this was my honey, I would add it to at least times
its volume of water that was pre-heated to 75°C (167°F)
and then hold the temperature between 70°C and 75°C
(158°F and 167°F) for 10 minutes .  You will want to stir
the honey and filter out the "pollen and stuff".  After
that add cold water to batch size, add yeas, nutrients, etc.
