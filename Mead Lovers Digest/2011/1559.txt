Hi!

I did a few test batches back in 2008 and was very disappointed by the
performance of 4184. That being said, from looking at my notes, it
sounds like it'd be a good match for what you're trying to do. My OG was
1.120 or so, FG was around 1.038. That was a little too sweet for my
tastes, but the dry finish yeast brought the other, identical batch down
to around 1.022.

A manufacturer's stated alcohol tolerance is the minimum ABV before alcohol
starts becoming toxic to the yeast.  A stated 11% ABV could be anywhere
between 11 point something and 12.5%.  So if you want a 10%, my advice is
to stop the fermentation.

Wout Klingens asks about predicting the final gravity of his sweet mead.
Predicting the degree of fermentation is one of the most difficult things
about wine/cider/meadmaking or brewing.  It takes a lot of experience with a
recipe and careful control of the process.  Even commercial producers often
only have a ballpark idea of their final gravities.

In your case you are starting with a very high gravity (1.130).  This places
a lot of stress on the yeast.  You are going to want to pitch a large yeast
starter, aerate the must well and add yeast nutrient.  I also recommend
progressive nutrient additions once fermentation begins.  Otherwise you risk
an unstable, stuck fermentation with a much sweeter result than you are
seeking.

I have to say my experience with Wyeast 4184 has been problematic.  I find
it to be "finicky," although others have reported good results.  Better for
me has been White Labs WLP720, with which I have had good luck on several
occasions.  Fermentation has completed, yet there is some residual
sweetness.

Doing the math, and assuming the O.G. you mention, 10 percent ABV would
result in an F.G. of 1.056, and 11 percent ABV would be 1.049.  I'd guess
something closer to the latter, but the stated alcohol tolerance of a yeast
strain is at best a rough estimate.  It also assumes that everything goes
well with your fermentation.

Others might tell you to make an offering to the mead gods and hope for a
fortuitous outcome.
