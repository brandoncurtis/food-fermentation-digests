&nbsp;My method to produce the correct sweetness for any of my meads is to
always aim low and add honey post-primary fermentation.<br /><br />I start
with 15lbs honey for a 5G batch using a champagne yeast. After primary
fermentation is complete I check the SG and check by taste and then add
more honey. Usually I'll add on the order of 2lbs more. This allows me to
adjust the sweetness for the particular flavor I'm making (I like certain
fruit meads to be sweeter than others), adjust for fermentation differences,
and tease a little more alcohol tolerance out of my yeast.<br /><br />Stephen

So I made a batch of cran-apple melomel and it finished at just below 8%.
 That was fine as it was supposed to be a soon-to-drink batch.  However it
was filled with off flavors and I have been letting it bulk age for over a
year now.  The taste has significantly improved, but I wonder how long can
I age a beverage at only 8% ABV.  The acid level tastes lower then I think
it really is (I haven't done an acid test, although I should and I am just
being lazy).  I assume that it is high because the cranberry juice was
local cold pressed stuff that made your lips fold inside out, the apple was
rather tart as well.  I know ageing is a function of acid and alcohol, but
I feel that I am too low to push much more then another year out of this
stuff.  Any suggestions, or does anyone have any experience ageing lower
ABV meads?

Thanks!

Wow.
3 answers and 1 PM. Thanks.
I think I am with Patrick St. Jean and give it a go, as he gives the thumbs
up on this:
" That being said, from looking at my notes, it sounds like it'd be a good
match for what you're trying to do."

I am going to try to explain my question and in the process respond to the
answers.
Yes, this Wyeast yeast seems to be a bit controversial. Hence my question.
But still the Wyeast info is quite clear: 11% ABV, temp range 65-75F.

In my experience and what I picked up with reading, for the home winemaker
there are a few things which determine a stable target FG.
1. alcohol tolerance of the yeast
2. attenuation
(http://www.homebrewtalk.com/wiki/index.php/Understanding_Attenuation),
which is a bit beyond me as yet 3. Composition of the honey 4. OG of the
must.
5. The amount of sugar in combination with the amount of alcohol.
6. a lot of other factors which I fotgot to mention here :)

Ad 1. The starting point for calculations.
Ad 2. As said: a bit beyond me. I don't like doing all kinds of nifty
measurements and control the outcome, as long as it is good to drink and
close to my goal.
Ad 3. The honey. Ah well... Let's see now.
- - So lighter honey usually has less nutrients, less solids (which means less
OG) and tends to let the pH drop during fermentation a lot more than dark
honey, which can result in sluggish fermentation or even a fermentation
stop.
- - Different kinds of honey have different amounts of sugar in them. Between
70% and 83%. "Only" a 13% difference.... The beekeepers can say a lot more
about that....
- - If the honey has a high percentage of fructose in it, it will leave a lot
more residual sugar, then when honey consists mainly of glucose, like rape
seed honey does. So a mead from rape seed honey will have less residual
sugar and a lot more alcohol.
Ad 4. I have fermented musts with more than 1.150 with no problem using the
right kind of yeast (I most often use Kitzinger Sauternes). Reference:
http://www.yquem.fr/yquem.php?lang=uk
If you look at the 2007 vintage fact sheet you see a 14.2% ABV and 137 g/L
residual sugar (~1.05 FG). So the the OG must have been around 1.150 or so.
Ad 5. A lot of us experienced, that you can "feed" your fermentation to
death. Sugar will kill yeast and if enough alcohol is present then even
sooner. So feeding small amounts at the time is indicated if you want high
alcohol percentage. So when you would start a must with 1.080 it would
ferment almost to dryness with this yeast, reaching the 11%. Using a higher
gravity would stop fermentation before this point. Pat reassures me with his
measurements, that with 1.120 it would be right on the nose, so I figured.

Yeah. Again some wordy post. Those things go through my mind, when I try to
make a new type of mead....
But what the heck. It fills the MLD and I hope it contributes to the general
discussion.
I hope to start it soon and inform you of the outcome (in 1 year or so).
Thanks again for the answers.
