[I'm sure this will be one of many responses.]

Basically, "attenuation" is relevant only to beer fermentation, as it is
a function of how well the yeast will ferment non-simple sugars (i.e.,
not glucose, fructose, maltose or sucrose). It's just not an issue with
mead, because "all" the sugars in honey are simple, and so the
theoretical attenuation is 100%. Mead fermentation will stop because of
other limits, such as alcohol tolerance, pH dropping too low, and low
nutrient levels.

So don't worry about the "attenuation" figures specified for yeast.
