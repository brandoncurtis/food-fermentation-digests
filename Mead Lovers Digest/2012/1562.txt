I would suggest an easier alternative to acheive a sweet mead would be to
use a lower amount of honey, something that will finish dry at the desired
ABV, then use the leftover honey you saved to backsweeten your mead to
taste after fermentation.

Much less chance of your gravity getting out of hand and you get exactly
the sweetness you want in the end.

You will use less honey overall and still get the mead you want. In my
estimate 2 lbs honey per gallon is about 11% ABV.
