Davoodoo writes in MLD #1562:

"I would suggest an easier alternative to achieve a sweet mead would be to
use a lower amount of honey, something that will finish dry at the desired
ABV, then use the leftover honey you saved to backsweeten your mead to taste
after fermentation."

It will be necessary to add potassium sorbate before the additional honey so
that the yeast does not awaken and ferment it.  Of course that will also
preclude the possibility of sparkling mead unless it is force carbonated.
But it will produce very good still sweet mead.

How do you Mead Lovers like to stop fermentation on mead?  Backsweetening
has a potential of wakening up a sleeping yeast even after a long time off
the clock.  I know a commercial meadery who chills their meads to the point
of freezing after the desired fermentation.  Then they rack, and add
infusions, herbs, etc.  Suggestions for those of us who do not care for
chemicals?

Thanks - Greg

I made a 6 gallon batch of Joe's Ancient Orange, because the 1 and 3 gallon
batches disappeared too quickly. I used 21.5 pounds of honey, 4 oranges, 4
cinnamon sticks and 4 cloves. OG was 1.163, FG is 1.035. I started it the
end of May and bottled it Mid-August. At that time the orange was a good
balance. I just shared a bottle with friends for New Year's Eve, and the
orange is now quite strong. I guess the next large batch should be only 3
oranges.
