Tom,
I don't have a lot of experience yet, but my first impression would be
that the apricot juice sounds very dilute, that there isn't a lot of
apricot in the juice, it's mostly sugar. It sounds like there was less
than 2 qts of actual apricot juice in over 20 qts of liquid, which isn't
much if you want a strong apricot flavor. I would suggest trying it with
fresh apricots or fresh apricots plus the juice. If you were brewing in
July, it might be a little late for fresh apricots, though it depends on
where you live. Out here (SF Bay Area), I've found u-picks that were
incredibly affordable for amazing apricots, if the price of the apricots
is an issue.  I would also be curious about the added sugar content of
the juice, which might be impossible to measure, as the nutrient facts
will only include the apricot juice sugar and the sugar together. That
might be a factor in it coming out pale.

Hi Folks,

I like to play with one-gallon batches of mead, trying different flavors
and combinations of honey and yeast. Currently, I have three batches
going. They are, Joe's Ancient Orange, with bread yeast, of course, a
mango mead, with Lalvin EC-1118, and a ginger mead, with Red Star Premium
Cuvee. I'm hoping the ginger ferments out a little dryer. I've never used
a yeast nutrient. Should I?

Thanks,
Chuck Dugan

It would be difficult if not impossible to determine how much apricot
brandy to use with each bottle, My suggestion would be to add some to
the whole batch, slowly, tasting as you go, and then bottle when you
have it just right.  This way, you know what you are getting and each
bottle will be identical.

My thanks to everyone who responded to my newbie request for help.  Here
are the answers to the questions some of you asked:

I did not.  Lesson learned!

Thanks.  This is a great tip, one I'll keep in mind with future meads.

Other than using fresh apricots (clearly the best option), what would you
have suggested I do to add additional flavor?

============================================

The "Yeast Nutrient" that my friendly neighborhood homebrew store sold.
(The label simply reads "Yeast Nutrient", but I'm guessing it's Diammonium
Phosphate)

In all my years of brewing, I've never been good at recording OG/FG.  In
fact, I've stopped measuring.

It was too thin, too film-y for particles.  I'm still not sure what it was.

Interesting idea.  My initial thought was to add a shot of apricot brandy
to each bottle after opening.  I'll try adding a touch of something sweet
to the mead to see if that helps out with the flavor.  Aside from using
whole fruit, what could I do next time to improve the flavor?

Many thanks again,

Tom

I haven't done it with rosemary or sage but I have done it with a
lavender mead I made a few years ago. The addition of the fresh lavender
sprigs did not make much of a difference in the flavor or aroma compared
to the bottles that did not have them, but it did look pretty. I only
used the stems with leaves, not the flowers, they went into the primary
ferment directly.
