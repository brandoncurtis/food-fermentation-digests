I too have experienced the goo that results from using fresh apricots and
peaches. So far the best approach I have found (at least for me) is to
use dehydrated fruit. I add the dehydrated fruit after the fermentation
is complete to avoid the action of fermentation tearing it apart. I would
typically leave the must on the fruit a month. This lets any extra sugar
from the fruit the opportunity to ferment out.  The fruit profile is nice
and seems fairly stable. I have experimented with adding small amounts of
vanilla post ferment to enhance the fruit character.

I used some dried chili-mangoes once with this method. It was very good
and disappeared quite rapidly.

Also I would use a large opening vessel as a fermenter with any kind of
fruit, never had good luck with a carboy and getting stuff back out.

Has anyone made this?  If so, I'd like to profit from your experience.  I
see some sites saying it is used for bittering.   Is that just the old,
brown leaves or do the new spring leaves add bitterness along with some
sugar?  Sounds like all you have to do is fill up the primary fermenting
bucket with oak leaves, fill it up with boiling water and let it sit
covered for about 5 days until you have an oak leaf tea.  Then mix in the
honey, etc.  Is there anything else I should know?

Thanks,
John Daly

I've got a cyser that's about 5 weeks old.  Ten days ago I added some oak
chips and just took them out tonight.  I can't say that I taste much
difference.  I used 1 oz. of chips (the package was 4 oz. and said it was
good for 25 gal. of wine, so I figured 1 oz. would be enough for my 5 gal.)
and soaked them for an hour beforehand as per instructions.  I discarded
the soaking water did not add it to the cyser.  I only left it in for 10
days because I'd heard that if you overdo it, it tastes like burnt wood.
But, after reading Ken Schramm sing the praises of oaking, I'm a bit
disappointed.
Thanks,
John Daly
