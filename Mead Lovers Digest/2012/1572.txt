Time to repeat a common caution:  Do NOT use red oak in a mead.  It will
add a flavor that most folks find disgusting, often described as cat
urine.

Red oak is common in the US for indoor uses like furniture and millwork
(molding and trim).  It's what you see in the lumber store if it's just
labeled "oak".  Avoid it.

John Daly says I've got a cyser that's about 5 weeks old.  Ten days ago I
added some oak chips and just took them out tonight.  I can't say that I
taste much difference.  I used 1 oz. of chips (the package was 4 oz. and
said it was good for 25 gal. of wine, so I figured 1 oz. would be enough
for my 5 gal.) and soaked them for an hour beforehand as per instructions.
I discarded the soaking water did not add it to the cyser.  I only left it
in for 10 days because I'd heard that if you overdo it, it tastes like
burnt wood. But, after reading Ken Schramm sing the praises of oaking, I'm
a bit disappointed.

Kevin Morgan replies:
John, we would need more info before making an educated reply.  For
instance, what kind of oak (American, French, Red, White)?  Also, was the
oak toasted or not, if toasted, to what degree was it toasted?  I usually
soak toasted American white oak in Vodka or Bourbon, then add the oak and
Vodka/Bourbon to the mead.  Using this method, one ounce for 10 days would
give a noticable result............Kevin

Thanks Kevin.  I'm not sure the details on my oak chips.  I bought them
from the local winemaking/homebrew store, they were from L. D. Carlson.
There was no indication of what type of oak or toast level, the color is
sort of light brown.  I looked on Carlson's website and couldn't find
anymore info, but they seem to be a reputable brand.  Maybe I'll try the
vodka/bourbon method or maybe just throw in 2 oz. next time.
