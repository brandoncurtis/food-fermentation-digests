Oak is great in mead.  Casks work well but are challenging to keep
clean.  With casks, I would leave my higher gravity melomels in the
cask for 1 to 2 weeks.  I have medium toast oak chips that I purchased
from a home brew store.  In a 5 gallon cherry melomel, I noticed a
very nice oak flavor after leaving approximately 1/2 cup of the oak
chips in for 1 week.  I did not boil the chips prior to the addition.
They went in approximately 2 weeks after racking from a 4 week primary
fermentation.  I'm a big fan of oak chips.

Hi All,

I have come into a rather large quantity of oranges.  After making and
canning two batches of orange marmalade I'm still left with lots of oranges.

Does anyone have a favorite orange mead recipe they'd care to share?  Also,
any suggestions on how to work with the fruit during the brewing process
would be equally appreciated!

Thanks,

Tom
