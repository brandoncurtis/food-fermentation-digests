When I have a lot of oranges, I peel, section, and freeze them. Linda and
I find them hard to distinguish from fresh fruit (thawed, of course). I've
done this in my favorite oranger mead recipe, the "Ancient Orange Mead"
in the archives. Bakers yeast and all.
Cheers.

Sure. I do.
Do a google search for "wout's orange mead".
Take a TA reading of your must to control your acid though!

You could also try a Joe's ancient.
So Wout or Joe, it's your call.

Cheers.
Guess who? :-)

The written records vanished in a basement flood, but I juiced enough
oranges for about a gallon and a half of juice, one gallon of honey,
and water to make a titch over five gallons.
I strained through cheesecloth at the start and at racking.
To give an interesting zing at the nose, I also zested about six or seven
oranges, putting that in a muslin bag in primary.
I apologize for a complete lack of numbers.
I can say that all regretted that there was no more

I just recently made a Tangello and Pomegranite Desert Blossom Honey Mead.
I squeezed 2 gallons of tangello juice and juiced two pounds of pomegranite
seeds and combined that with 7.5 pounds of Desert Blossom Honey and about
a half gallon of water. The volume was just over 3 gallons and the Original
gravity was 1088, I used a Red Star Cuvee yeast. I racked it at 4 weeks and
added another gallon of fresh squeezed tangello juice, it is still in the
secondary and soon to be racked to tertiary to age and clarify a bit. so
far it tastes like a mead mimosa, I think that it has great potential.

I believe that when it is finished and cleared I'll add 1 cup of honey
with one cup of water boiled together to condition and bottle it, and have
a nice sparkling tangello mead mimosa.

Tom asked about using oranges in mead.  I made a nice orange melomel.
I started zesting and pealing the oranges and adding the orange zest and
the fruit to a year old clover mead.  After a while, I told myself that
the only thing I was throwing away was the pith.  I tasted the pith and
it had very little taste and a little astringency.  So I simply quartered
the rest of the (seedless) oranges and threw them in.  It came out quite
nice with the added zest adding some zip.  I think this approach works
best with mead that is a little flabby - i.e. mead that needs a bit of
added astringency, such as grape tannin to liven up the flavor.

Hi Folks,

I'm currently making a mango mead. I've peeled and sliced the mango's and
added them to the fermenter. Any suggestions on how long I can safely leave
the fruit in there? Is there any chance the fruit can spoil? Are there
"safe" or "unsafe" fruits?

Thanks!

Does anyone have a favorite orange mead recipe they'd care to share?  Also,
any suggestions on how to work with the fruit during the brewing process
would be equally appreciated!

I have made a couple batches with oranges. The trick, IMHO, is to add
another significant flavor.

My straight orange (with just a little spice) was good but you can't really
drink too much of it.

Mixing it with a cranberry mead produced a great combination. The flavors
work well and complement each other to produce a well balanced mead .

I currently have an orange brewing with spices I normal would use in what I
refer to as Firewater.

As far as the oranges, I wash them, then take off the zest and store for
later. (Lots of aromatics that I add back after primary). Just the remaining
fruit and add to the primary. Later add the zest as a sort of dry-hopping,
if you will.

The spices that I used for the Spiced Orange include (for 5 gals)
1oz nutmeg, grated
3 sticks vanilla bean
2 tsp black tea
1/2 cup cinnamon chunks
16oz ginger, peeled and sliced
1/8 cup cloves
Spices added in a brewbag except for ginger that goes right in.
Stew for 30min @ 180F then extracted

Then my normal 15lbs of honey (to start, I always back sweeten to get the
specific sweetness I'm looking for)
5 cups of juice added after mixture chills. This is about 15+ oranges, I
often get a case from Costco for this

Then follow your standard inoculation practice.

Stephen
