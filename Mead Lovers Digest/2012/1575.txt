The juice can be tricky because of it's high acid content.  I stick to 50%
or less citrus juice because of this (I get a healthier ferment that way).
You will likely want a sweet mead to counter this acid.  Zest is key to
the citrus flavor and aroma in my opinion:  it will give you a lot without
the difficult to balance acidity.  I hope that helps you get started.

Folks -
Those of you using LinkedIn, please beware that it is relatively easy to
slip up and end up inviting everyone in your address book to add themselves
to "your professional network".

Don't do it deliberately--there's no point in inviting either mead or
mead-request to join you on LinkedIn, nor befriend you, tweet at you,
etc.

But I do understand that social-networking software can be aggressive in
seeking contacts.  If I see these requests I'll let you know--just in case
you don't realize you've triggered them.  But I won't hold them against
you.

Hi,

Has anyone tried a kelp-metheglin?
Some wines do have an umami taste and I wonder if adding kombu would enhance
it spoiling a good mead flavor.
I would hate to add glutamate powder to my mead, but kelp would be ok to my
feelings.

Regards,
Wout.
