Subject: Is mead Kosher for Passover?

While the GF and I aren't Jewish, we have several friends that are, and we
have recently been invited to an "eclectic Seder" that one of them has been
hosting for many years, and which we've attended several times in the past.

It is a potluck event, that is "quasi-kosher" in that guests are asked
to bring dishes that at least nominally follow the kosher rules, even
if most don't actually do a kosher kitchen.  One of the things that I've
asked in the past, and haven't really gotten a good answer on is whether
or not meads are "Kosher for Passover" (KFP).  In the past the answer I
got was unsure, but don't bring it just to be on the safe side...

I'd be interested if there are any mead makers with relevant expertise as
to whether or not mead is KFP or not.  While not as bad as Mogen David,
I've not been terribly impressed by the KFP wines that others have brought,
and frankly think my stuff is better...

Aside from getting blessed by the Rabbi, what makes KFP wine KFP?

Or, in the spirit of the event -  "What makes this wine different from all
other wines?" ;-}

Thanks for the advice!

I'm looking at making a 5 gallon batch of orange mead with about 12 lbs of
honey.

I squeezed about two dozen oranges last night and have the zest from the
majority of them as well.  In fact, the zest is in a pair of quart jars
topped off with some of the orange juice.

When I made my 5 gallon batch of apricot mead I used 9 lbs. honey and a
gallon of apricot 'nectar' with about the same amount of water.  Would you
recommend using the two quart jars of juice and zest I have and 1 1/2
gallons of water?  Or some other combination?

And is there anything else that I can do to make sure the acidity is kept
in check?

Many thanks!

Tom
