This is similar to a note I wrote last July, except that I'm not saying
"please" this time.

When you post or reply to the Digest, DO NOT include an entire copy of
a prior Digest as part of your posting.  Include a bit of relevant text
if you need to give context for a reply.  If your mailer starts off a
reply by including the entire "original message", TRIM IT DOWN.

What happens if you don't?  There's a mechanical check in getting a Digest
ready to go; it tries to catch these full-digest inclusions and push them
off to one side.  Then I have to clean them up by hand and stick them back
in the queue.  If I'm in a good mood and not busy, it happens right away.
If I'm busy, grumpy, or forgetful, they'll get cleaned up and appear in
a later Digest when I remember and get around to it.

I'm writing about this again because there's been an upswing in postings
which quote entire previous digests.

I realize people slip up once in a while when creating an email reply,
so I've done the cleanup and sent a "friendly reminder".  But folks,
the MLD is not a training ground for using email.  And while I do the
cleanup which is necessary because of how various mailers format mail,
I don't see a good reason to do cleanup that you could/should have done.

So I'll change the policy.  For the time being at least, I'll continue to
give the friendly reminder and clean up the posting the first time a
person does it.  If it happens again, I may just toss the posting.

Only unleavened bread items are allowed during Passover so since yeast does
the leavening, I would think mead would not be allowed.  Exodus 12:14-16
is pretty harsh on the unleavened issue.  On the other hand, if wine is
allowed, why not Mead?  On the third hand, the reason for unleavened bread
was because they had to take off on their journey, and wine or mead that
is finished, has no more yeast, yes?  So it might fulfill the "no leaven"
proscription.  Ah, superstition.   Why not ask a strict Orthodox rabbi?

The definition of 'kosher' really varies.  While Lalvin yests has that
'kosher symbol' on it, there are those who say that all yeast is kosher.
I've also seen the kosher symbol on honey while others say that all honey
is kosher.

Be careful of what fining agents you use.  Super-Kleer (and others like it)
use 'shellfish derivative.'  Using this would certainly make your batch
not kosher.

I think, unless you want a mead that will jump up your nose and grapple
your sinuses into submission, you reserved about four times the zest you'll
need.
My zested orange mead hit with enough zest that, although it was tasty,
you felt compelled to share it because a 12 oz bottle was more than you
wanted to tackle

ART,

I?m Jewish and do the KFP thing for passover but do not keep Kosher
year round. What makes a normal wine not Kosher for Passover (KFP)
is the yeast in it and other addatives like Corn Syrup. (If you want
to get really technical, there are some other ingredients that cannot
be used for KFP foods as well). The yeast, which is the main concern,
cannot have come into contact with any bread products while being made,
(which is the big thing around Passover).
The yeast must be made from sugars and fruits, although the problem is,
its hard to tell where the yeast comes from and how it is made when picking
it up at the local supplies store. The KFP wines that are out there dont
use corn syrup and other non-kosher items and use yeast that has been made
from sugars and fruits.

I agree with you, the Passover wines out there suck! I'm sure the mead
will go over much better at the Seder, Elijah will like it too I'm sure!
