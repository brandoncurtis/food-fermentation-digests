Yes, it would be important to know the OG of the must and the strain of yeast
that was originally pitched, also how does the finished product taste? Is
it overly sweet? 1005 is an acceptable FG in many cases, I believe that is
the equivalent  of approx .5% additional alcohol by volume, not much in a
higher gravity mead.............. If you are really concerned about it,
calc out where you stand now on ABV and go for a second fermentation,
more honey, a champagne or dry mead yeast and more nutrient, check the
OG of the new must and keep a running tally, figure it all out in the
end. You can get some interesting and complex results with secondary and
even tertiary fermentations using different yeast strains.

I made a low alcohol tupelo mead but it has finished quite tart like it
was squeezed from a citrus fruit. I did not add any fruit. Is there any
way to reduce the tartness?
