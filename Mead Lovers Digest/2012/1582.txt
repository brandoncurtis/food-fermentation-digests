Chris asks:
I made a low alcohol tupelo mead but it has finished quite tart like it was
squeezed from a citrus fruit. I did not add any fruit. Is there any way to
reduce the tartness?

Yes. Blend with a less tart mead.

Regards,
Wout.

Without knowing more, that sounds like a lactobacillus infection.  A form a
yeast that produces lactic acid, good in sour beers, sour dough's, yogurt,
and the like but not mead.  It could be a problem with the way
you sanitized or just a 1 in a 1000 random chance.  Are you careful to
fully sanitize your equipment?

Cheers,
Graham
