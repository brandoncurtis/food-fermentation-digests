I added a healthy sprig of rosemary to a bottle of mead, re-corked and let
it set in the cellar for about 3 months.  Upon opening it, the aroma of
rosemary was clearly present.  There was so much rosemary aroma and flavor
that the rosemary infused mead was not drinkable.  However, if you enjoy
rosemary, this mead-extracted-rosemary is absolutely wonderful on salads,
chicken [before and after cooking], and great in carbonated water with
lemon juice.  We are only now discovering some of the things to use this
marvelous extract for.
