As soon as I read this, thoughts of enhancing my lemon Mead began
running through my head. So I filled 2 one liter bottles with my sweet
lemon Mead, added a 1/4 tsp of fairly old crushed rosemary to one
of them, and put them both of them in the refrigerator for an hour.

This Mead initially fermented dry.  Rather than back-sweetening with
honey, I added 8 grams of (250 x sugar) Stevia and the result is still
too sweet for me.

After an hour in the fridge, the verdict is the Mead is still too sweet,
but the Rosemary makes it more drinkable.
