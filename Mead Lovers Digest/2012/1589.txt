I'd guess that this is what you suggested, an old
family recipe passed on through the generations
that probably won't appear in a book or other
reference.  It might be best to try and duplicate
the recipe as best you can.

One suggestion ??? if this is an old ethnic recipe,
you can try a ???net search for mead and the
ethnic group and see if anything comes up
that looks similar.  For instance, looking for
Lithuania and mead, or Russia and mead, can
turn up old recipes for Eastern European styles
of mead.

Any one looking for local bulk honey should find their local bee club.
Search here:

Keep those dollars local.

Most are cheap to join ($15-20) and the contacts are priceless.
Maybee you will decide to get a few hives.
Bees and a real job keep me from making as much mead as I'd like.

  Hello,

  My grandmother (my mother's mum) used to make a Honey Mead recipe from
  the bee hives grandma used to have on her farm.  It is a very old recipe
  (mum is now 83 years old), the recipe used grains such as wheat, barley,
  maize, rye and hops, along with the honey, long before acidity
  regulators, enzymes or campden tablets were ever invented.

  Sounds like a braggot to me.  I know this isn't much help but perhaps
   some others out there in Cyberland can suggest a few recipes that might
  come close.  Good luck!

Hello, my name is Sam and I am a graduate student working on a
comprehensive history of mead. In doing so I am trying to find every source
possible that details the history of the drink--from all areas of the
world. I am writing to ask if anyone has any good sources to please forward
them to me. I think for this you can email me directly, so as to not stuff
up the digest-- slaughter.sj@gmail.com.

Thanks! Once my thesis is completed I'd be willing to let anyone interested
read it!
