It is possible.  It is also possible that the yeast has reached it's limit
of alcohol tolerance.
It would help immensely for you to acquire a hydrometer, and measure the
gravity at every step-
then you would KNOW if the added honey was attenuated or not.

 I don't know that I'd assume you're losing your CO2 when you open the
bucket - it's heavy, will sit low on top of your must... Also, I'm not sure
I'd  necessarily call oxidation a bad thing, part of what gives older wines
their character (aged behind cork, not in bulk).  That's a personal taste
thing, though.

With that said, maybe you've hit the wall in what your yeast can handle re
alcohol - maybe a champagne yeast starter?  Low on nutrient, maybe add a
little?  And maybe consider a little O2 - stir it up?  I understand if
you're against that last one, but if we were talking a high gravity beer, I
would do that.

Good luck!
Brent

Greetings Fellow Meaders..

   I got a wild hair after a friend brought me a bunch of must - go
Bananas.. I made bread.. and then more bread.. and then what do you think
any self respecting meader would do ?  I fermented those bad boys..

Well I confess its not a pure mead.. why ?  Because I wanted to be sure
I got some really good Fosters Recipe Taste in there.. so I fermented it
with honey and brown sugar.. and cinnamon..   Now that it is coming to
the point of its final racking, and aging,, I am pondering 2 points..

1 )  I want to add some rum and I would like some suggestions.. I am
thinking some dark jamaican rum of some ilk.. so I get more flavor and
less alcohol taste..   Suggestions ?  Brands ??

2) Just as wines which had brandy added were Ports.. is there a proper name
for this type of concoction ?

Thanks !

Mark

As a beekeeper, I know of no green honey excepting, and it is
a truly faint green tint to otherwise light yellow honey, the
honey of Purple Loosestrife.

Might the honey you have come from a large swamp that is essentially
a Purple Loosestrife monoculture?

RE: Green Honey

I would bet that the hive that honey came from is located near a soda
factory.  The bees will collect any source of sugar and if it is the corn
syrup laced Mountain Dew concentrate, they won't care.  Don't expect much
from it, but give it a run and see.

Try it,

remember green eggs and ham,

Sam i am...

one gallon batches are my main thing now...

sorry for the silly post all.

My father just got home with a bottle of green honey he received from a
friend. it smells faintly of alcohol, and and it tastes differently from
the regular honey that we have. I'm wondering if anyone has made mead out
of it in the past. What do you guys know about green honey?
