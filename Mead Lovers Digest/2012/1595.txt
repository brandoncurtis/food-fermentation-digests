I've written a brewing app for the iPhone called BrewBot, which includes
2 mead specific calculators which let you determine mead OG based on
honey and water. Also, you can calculate the amount of honey needed for
back sweetening a batch of mead.

I have a limited number of free download codes for anyone interested in
testing.

You can check it out here: http://itunes.com/apps/brewbot

Hello, I was just wondering if there are many meadmakers in the UK and if
there are any get togethers / competitions that happen here in the UK.  If
not maybe there can be some sort collaboration of effort to put something
together for the British people. I have a few Ideas and would like to see
if they are viable.

Regards

Ben

usable for late harvest wines.  got no ST on hand and local shops only
