I am pleased to announce the 8th Annual VALHALLA 'The Meading of Life' an
AHA/BJCP sanctioned amateur mead only competition. This year's competition
will be held Saturday, October 20, 2012 at our gracious host, Iron Hill
Brewery & Restaurant in West Chester, PA.  We are looking for judges and of
course entrants with Mead.

Entries must be received by October 6th, 2012.  The fee is $7 per entry.
Each entry must consist of two bottles if smaller than 22 ounces (6oz.,
12oz., etc.), one 22 oz. bottle, or one 750 ml bottle. We suggest sending 2
bottles per entry for sparkling meads so a fresh bottle can be opened for
Best of Show.   Please visit the competition website www.valhalla-mead.com
for forms, drop off locations and all other information.

Feel free to contact me with any questions.  Good luck to all entrants!

Has anyone made this?  The link to the source on gotmead is included.
I'm having trouble finding Lalvin D254 and wondered about using sweet mead
or D47 instead. Also, any other hints are welcome.

This is for a 6  gallon batch of Chocolate Acerglyn (Semisweet). I
Recommend using 6.5 gallon carboys.
2006
In Primary Bucket (do not use a glass  carboy during the first 3 days or
you'll have a Chocolate Geyser!!!)
1.3 gallons (16lbs) GloryBee Wildflower Honey (Excellent for Wildflower)
other wildflower honeys questionable
10oz Ghirardelli's unsweetened cocoa
powder.http://www.foodlocker.com/95341-9.html
4 gallons of bottled spring water
Lalvin D254 (Rehydrated in goferm) I absolutely love what this yeast did
for this batch!!!!
2 tsp (total)  DAP - staggered additions over 1st 3 days during oxygenation
2 tsp (total) Fermaid K - Staggered additions over 1st 3 days during
oxygenation
At end of 3rd day pour (using a sterilized funnel) into a glass  carboy -
this pour is your final  aeration
Ferment in a 6.5  gallon Glass Primary
Rack into secondary at 1 blip every 15 seconds, Rack Under the Oils
In 6.5  gallon Secondary -
Gently degas before adding 1/2  gallon Grade B Dark Maple Syrup
Stir Well but do not  aerate.
Add approx. 1  gallon Bottled Spring Water, stir gently.
When  fermentation is complete rack into a 6  gallon  Carboy and bulk age
for at least one year. Enjoy!!!

I read a little about happens when you freeze mead to separate it from the
water and up the flavor and alcohol percent.
Does anyone have any tips on technique or could give a ball-park of the
final ABV?
Is this illegal for personal consumption? I have heard both Yes and No to
the question.
Just looking for some guidance before I consider doing this.
