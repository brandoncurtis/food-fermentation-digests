I Yahooed D254 and found retailers.  D47 seems to be similar, but the author
appears mesmerized with D254.  So first I'll ask my LHBS (Maryland Homebrew)
if they can get D234 for me.
If not, I'll buy it online.

This reads like a really fantastic recipe.  Will start this in October on
the Sunday after Valhalla!

Wrath said it turned out fabulous when he made it. He's been MIA on Gotmead
for a while, I think his real life caught up with him, LOL.

Wassail!

This question comes up every few years on this digest.  It has been
thoroughly researched and answered many times.  The short answer is:  It is
not illegal.

Distillation is defined specifically, and it involves heating the must, and
by evaporation removing the alcohol.  Freezing the must and removing the
water (ice) is not distillation, by definition.  If you want more details,
search the archives, there are some very specific references in there.

But really, the whole topic is silly, unless you are planning on selling
it.  Freezing can't get the high alcohol concentrations of distillation,
and no doors are going to be kicked down because your mead is slightly over
24%.

   This does go on, probably quite a bit, but I've never heard about
anyone getting busted for it. There's no way the government has enough
agents to try and crack down on some poor slob who freezes a bit of mead
every so often.

WAIT A SECOND! They could hire all the still unemployed people and solve
two problems at once. :)

  I did this with less than a quart of mead once. I put it in a large
bowl in the freezer part of my refrigerator, let it start to freeze. I
think I used a timer, 30 minutes or so? Poured it through a strainer
leaving ice crystals behind. I did this about four times until no more
ice formed. A colder freezer might have taken it farther.
  I didn't get much, but it was pretty good.
  I guess there is no definite consensus on the legality, but I suspect
the govt has more important things to do than bust someone making a
couple bottles of home brew. If you tried to sell it though . . .
