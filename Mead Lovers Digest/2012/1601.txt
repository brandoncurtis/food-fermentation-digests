Mixture data 02 Oct 12
Started mix 16 Jun 12
Mix: 1 lb honey (wildflower I think) & 1 GL H2O with
Banana
Tangerine peel & pith mostly (very finely cut like the rest of the ingredients)
Cinnamon sticks
Green Tea
Red Seedless Grapes
Cilantro
Red Pepper
Watermelon (mostly the white outer margin)

It sure tastes good!
It gives me some different sensation from other alcohol & all, sort of like a
healthy vibration in every cell.
I suspect it's from such a rarely varied & powerful amount of vitamins & such
:-)
In this beginning, I'm getting greater amounts of Green Tea from the portion
that remains floating on the surface & it sure is good!
I doubt I'll bother to combine all these exact things again but I sure want to
keep adding Green Tea, probably greater amounts since it's so inexpensive &
available & conveniently pre cut & seems to be good for everything.
But that's not at all to say I regret any of the other ingredients & I'm
reconsidering combining so many ingredients, as I suspect it has even medicinal
value when one needs lots of nutrition & variety, maybe sort of like a Mead
MultiVitamin :-)
It's flavor probably changes over time & I'll probably drink it all before long
:-)
