Subject: adding yeast nutrient after fermentation has started?
From: Bob Anzlovar <rcanzlovar@gmail.com>

I've started a batch of traditional mead using about 12 pounds of honey and
yeast. When I started it, it had a specific gravity of 1.09. After a month
or so, it's dropped to about 1.05 but the fermentation is going slowly, and
my spouse is impatient.

Would it make sense to add yeast nutrient at this point to move things
along? The articles i've found online say that yeast nutrient is added at
the beginning, but nothing seems to address adding it later. Thoughts?

Thanks for any help.
