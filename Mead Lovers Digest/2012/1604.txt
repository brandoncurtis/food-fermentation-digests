I often use the technique of essentially starting over with stuck
fermentations. A few honeys have enough nutrients so I start out as a show
mead (only honey, water and yeast).  If it sticks, try warming up the must.
If that doesn't work, add some nutrients and energizer - Being SURE to first
dissolve them or anticipate a science fair type volcano! Allow oxygen into
it and allow some aerobic yeast multiplication and then back to anaerobic
sugar to CO2 and ethanol fermentation.
