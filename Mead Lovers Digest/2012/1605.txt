I read a recipe for a beginner's mead a while back, and I can't seem
to find it again...

It was written in a very cute/conversational style.

I want to say it was 2# honey in a gallon jug, 1 orange, a handful of
raisins, and Bread yeast...

anyone?

There might be a relevant link on

Look for Ken Schramm's article Mastering mead: Optimizing Honey
Fermentation,
If the document isn't to your liking initially, then scroll down to
fermentation protocol about nutrient additions and the time you have to add
it.

>From the same author, I think, I read that leaving too much unused nutrients
in the mead while it's not dry, increases the danger of in-bottle
re-fermentation.
So with sweet meads you need to be careful.
Very interesting reading for the "molecular cooks" among us.
And for the impatient spouses: you can't hurry love, you'll just have to
wait. You can't hurry mead. You can't hurry mead, made with love.
And you certainly should not hurry drinking mead made with love, while
drinking it with your love.
I feel a song coming on.

Cheers,
Wout
