Sounds like Joe's Ancient Orange Mead.

Subject: Pre-crystalization or Glucose deficient honey for mead making.

In addition to the pollen, fragrances from the fruits/flowers that the bees
go to, there is the sugar distribution that makes each honey distinct.  Ken
Schramm gives a great discussion and detailed chart of the sugars mixes
that are present in honey [pages 96-7 in The Complete Mead Maker, =A9
2003].  Among
the points he makes is that the distribution of sugar types has an impact
on the final complexity of the mead.

So, what would the final effect be on mead if you deliberately
crystallized-out some of the sugar [glucose] and used glucose deficient
honey to make the mead?  I would suspect that you might need 10% more honey
from this pre-crystalized honey to make the mead just to have sufficient
sugars content to make the mead you would ordinarily make.  I would think
that the pollen and fragrances would be concentrated in this process
leading to that more complex tasting mead that Schramm alludes to.  Several
references I read say that glucose is the sugar that crystallizes first,
given the interest in diabetes, there must be a simple way for mead makes
to check the glucose level of their honey.

So, my questions:

1) Any one actually tried to crystalize some of the sugars out of honey and
used this glucose deficient honey in mead?

2) Any pit-falls besides making my mead more expensive and time-consuming?

Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated.
