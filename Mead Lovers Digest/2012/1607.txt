The American Homebrewers Association is now accepting submissions for
educational seminars and poster presentations at the 2013 AHA National
Homebrewers Conference in Philadelphia, PA, June 27-29.

The conference theme, Brewing Up a Revolution, is based on Philadelphia
playing a large part in the American Revolution and being at the edge of
brewing revolutions throughout American history. This conference will
present ideas to keep the modern brewer at the forefront of homebrewing,
mead-making, and cider-making.

For more information, please review the presentation guidelines &
requirements on www.AHAconference.org before you submit a proposal.
