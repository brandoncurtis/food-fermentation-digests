RE:pre-crystalization or glucose deficient...

Well, by definition if you remove the glucose you will make the flavors
less complex, but removing glucose could possibly allow the tasting of
other flavors that may or may not get covered up in the presence of the
glucose. So there's that.

I think you may have to use some special chemistry equipment to crystallize
out one specific sugar which could get spendy. Also, I'm not sure what
the reference to diabetes was, but in case you were suggesting that by
removing the glucose you would make mead safer for a diabetic I am afraid
that is not the case. The body turns fructose into glucose anyway as part
of the digestion process.
