Just read the Glucose post on the last digest.   somewhat related,  A
friend who is loving my mead wanted me to make one with Agave syrup, as
opposed to honey.  (i am told it is easier for diabetics to handle),  I
guess it's not mead, if there is no honey,  but i tried it as a lark.
 added some leechees for acid, and balance,  and it's bubbling away.
my knowledge is very limited, but i think it doesn't matter what type of
sugar, so long as the little yiesties are able to feast on it,  i think the
resulting alcohol is always going to be the same, chemically speaking. as
far as i know.
Any experiences with fermenting agave anyone?
