> Any experiences with fermenting agave anyone?

1/10/98 Agave Mead - 3 lbs. agave syrup, 12 oz. Cucamonga honey, ~88
Oz. Water to 1 gal, 1 tbs. energizer, OG 1.130.  I would have used an
alcohol tolerant yeast, probably Red Star Flor Sherry.

It always had a strong taste, too strong for easy drinking.  I just
tasted it again today to see how it's aged.  It far more drinkable now
than it has ever been, but it's still a bit too astringent to rest
easily in the mouth.  I recommend a ratio with more honey to give it a
better balanced taste.  You might be able to back sweeten, something
I've thought about but never done, given the small batch size.

When yours is ready, please post the results, and let me know if you
do add honey.  I was glad I didn't make a 5gal batch, but would
consider trying again if I wasn't shooting in the dark.

BTW, Tupelo honey is known to contain far more complex carbohydrates
than other honeys.  I've heard it's the honey of choice for diabetics,
but not being one myself I've never researched it.  If you do look
into this, please post what you learn, I'm sure others would find that
interesting too.

Aside from alcohol, which I believe is a problem for diabetics, a dry
mead shouldn't be a problem, because the sugars should be pretty much gone.

I guess it would be a form of pulque, even though agave nectar is filtered,
heated, and condensed and the sap that makes pulque is all natural it
might still qualify.
I hope your using fresh lychees, I hate the canned ones (won't even eat
them, but then again I have a ready supply from my grandfathers 5 trees),
but you use what you can. I find the Brewster variety to be the best for mead
because they have a high acid level and a very concentrated lychee flavor.
I don't understand why diabetics can't drink a dry wine? All the glucose
is converted, is it some other problem or do people just not like dry mead?

According to the American Diabetes Association, "Agave nectar raises blood
glucose a little more slowly (it has a lower glycemic index) than sugar and
other sweeteners that provide calories. It is okay for people with diabetes
to use agave nectar as a sweetener, but they should not treat it any
differently than regular sugar or corn syrup. It provides just as many
calories and carbohydrates as regular sugar, honey, etc." So, I'd say that
while you'll be losing the all the flavors and aromas of honey, you won't
be gaining any health benefits by using agave syrup.

Agave 'nectar' has a low glycemic index because it's nearly 90% fructose,
but then again kerosene has a low glycemic index too. Nearly all of what's
available on the market is a highly processed chemical product in contrast
to the natural goodness and simplicity of bee puke. By all means
experiment, and good luck to you, you may discover something really
special! I'll continue to use pure honey and be counseling my diabetic
friends to go easy on any alcoholic beverage.
