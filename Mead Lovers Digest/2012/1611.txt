Subject: Mead directly from a Carboy or beverage container

As I am washing wine bottles for bottling two 5 gal. batches of mead I got
to wondering if anyone has tried a system similar to kegging beer - where a
5 gal batch can be stored all at once in a stainless steel beverage
container and be delivered a glass or two at a time.

I called a local gas supplier and they do sell nitrogen gas in "5 lbs"
containers.  The CO2 regulator needs an adapter but can handle nitrogen as
both are non-flammable.

Any one have experience with mead in a stainless steel beverage container
for say 6 to 8 months - or what ever length of time it takes to consume a
batch of mead?

Is there an adapter or system that allows deliver of mead directly from a
carboy - after the last racking of course - perhaps with a small bit of
nitrogen pressure.

Bottom line, trying to get away from washing those wine bottle that I
recycle.

Happy Thanksgiving.
