The only downside I can see with your system is that nitrogen also dissolves
in water, and that you will still have a sparkling mead, but with nitrogen
bubbles which are smaller than CO2 -- I remember hearing about the size
of the gas from several of my beer sites, not from my own experience.

If you're okay with a sparkling (or semi-sparkling) mead, then it's fine
with either gas.  If you depressurize the mead after each dispense, you can
minimize the effects, just letting the compressed gas push it out.  But you
will never get to a point like that where the product is completely still.

Henry asks about serving mead from stainless steel.  Yes you can, almost
all my meads are in the "standard" 5 gallon corny kegs widely used for
homebrewed beer.  I have both a nitrogen regulator and a CO2 regulator.  I
have been using a "beer gas" blend in the nitrogen system for still and low
carbonation beverages and CO2 for sparkling ones.  I have had no problems
leaving meads in kegs for several years; just make sure there is enough gas
pressure to maintain a seal on the lid.  If you are serving an acidic mead
or wine you do want to make sure to use all stainless steel or plastic taps
and associated equipment as the acids tend to eventually eat the nickle
platting on the chromed taps.

As for putting gas pressure on a carboy, it sounds like a bad idea to me as
carboys are not designed to take pressure.  I've heard of folks using gas
pressure to start a siphon but the idea of high velocity glass shards
scares me.

I have kept and served mead from typical stainless steel corny kegs that
homebrewers use.  No problems at all.   Kept it refrigerated.  Even filled
bottles from the keg later.   Like all kegging, just let it settle, and
fine, in the carboy so you aren't carrying over much in the way of yeast
that will settle out later.    Low gravity hydromels are particularly
suitable for kegging since they are very quaffable.   You can serve on
nitrogen or even "beer mix" or "party mix" a combination of CO2 and
Nitrogen.   As I recall the same regulator and connectors are used for that
since it's not pure nitrogen.

Subject: Mead directly from a Carboy or beverage container

To address your question: >I got to wondering if anyone has tried a system
similar to kegging beer - where a 5 gal batch can be stored all at once in a
stainless steel beverage container and be delivered a glass or two at a time.


I have been using stainless kegs for mead for the last 30 years (as well
as stainless fermenters) it works great.
I generally age mead in the 5 gallon soda kegs but have used 15 gallon beer
kegs as well. The kegs are nice for doing
Sparkling meads and are easy to filter and CP bottle off of.
The longest I have aged a mead in a SS container is maybe 20 years.
I frequently have meads on draft, especially in the summer. I use a 70/30
nitrogen - CO2 mix to pressure the system.

I do it all the time. I just use the same corny kegs as I do for beer,
and the same co2 tank. The only difference s that I only keep a minimal
amount of co2 in the mead & wine kegs, just enough to keep a blanket of
gas over the mead/wine, but not enough to dispense the beverage with.
When it comes time to pour a glass, I just hit the keg with some
additional co2, and dispense as many glasses as need. Once done serving
I release the pressure in the keg. Doing it this way, the wine or mead
keeps for a long time - I have some in that have keen in kegs for 2+
years without any problems - but the liquid does not get carbonated as
it would if stored at higher pressure.

Last Digest Hal asked if anyone has used kegging equipment.  I have and
find it works really well.  I am a brewer as well, so I have the equipment
on-hand.  I like just a slight carbonation, but I don't see why you
couldn't turn that up.  It would be hard to keep it still, since you would
have to disconnect and purge extra CO2 every time you finished with your
keg for the day.  I recomend trying it if you have the equipment.  I also
have a counter-pressure filler for bottling that sparkling mead, which
comes in handy.

Cheers,
Graham

I have successfully packaged and bottled sparkling mead in 5 gallon
stainless corny kegs.  I didn't detect any flavor or aroma from the keg and
wouldn't expect it to be a concern.  However, bear in mind that the  necessary
co2 pressure to keep away oxygen and allow the keg to remain sealed  will
eventually carbonate the mead.  I wouldn't recommend dispensing and  using
pressure to serve mead from a glass carboy.  They are not designed to  hold
pressure and could create an bad situation if they break with a volume of  mead
exploding.

Cleaning bottles doesn't have to be difficult or time consuming.  Fill  up
a big plastic tub or bucket with the bottles and your choice of cleaner
(B-brite, bleach, tsp, BLC,) and let them soak for a few days.  The labels
will come off easily.  Rinse the bottles well and proceed to sanitize them
before bottling.  You can't sanitize dirt or labels so I like to clean
everything before filling used bottles.

Any one have experience with mead in a stainless steel beverage  container
for say 6 to 8 months - or what ever length of time it takes to  consume a
batch of mead?

Is there an adapter or system that allows  deliver of mead directly from a
carboy - after the last racking of course -  perhaps with a small bit of
nitrogen pressure.

Bottom line, trying to  get away from washing those wine bottle that I
recycle.

Happy  Thanksgiving.
