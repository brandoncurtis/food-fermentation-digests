Vuarra says:
The only downside I can see with your system is that nitrogen also dissolves
in water, and that you will still have a sparkling mead, but with nitrogen
bubbles which are smaller than CO2 -- I remember hearing about the size
of the gas from several of my beer sites, not from my own experience.

While nitrogen is indeed soluble in water it is about 2 orders of magnitude
less soluble than CO2.   At 10oC and one atmosphere of pressure, CO2 will
dissolve about 2.5g of gas per Kg of water while nitrogen will dissolve
about .025g or gas per Kg of water.   So at low dispensing pressures, there
will little to no gas bubbles in the mead.   It's not a matter of bubble
size but whether there will be much if any dissolved gas in the mead.
Using the beer gas/party gas mix the CO2 will go into solution at the
partial pressure of the CO2 but the nitrogen will have little impact on the
"carbonation."   That's why one uses that to push beer at higher pressures
for longer draft runs without over carbonating the beer.

I have been experimenting  with using argon instead of N2 or CO2 when I
am serving a still mead. Since argon is not absorbed by liquid there isn't
any sparkling affects.
