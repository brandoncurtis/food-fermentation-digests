Wow, there's a lot of misconception running around here.

1. Nitrogen is very slightly soluble in water (0.02g N2 / kg H2O at
20C). As Dave Houseman pointed out, this is much lower than CO2
solubility (2g CO2 / kg H2O at 20C). But there's more to it than that.
The "fizz" of carbonated beverages is partly due to the bubbles, but
much more due to the carbonic acid that results when CO2 dissolves in
water, and when it hits your mucus membranes. Nitrogen does not give
this effect.

2. Argon is MORE soluble in water than Nitrogen (0.06 g Ar / kg H2O at 20C).
