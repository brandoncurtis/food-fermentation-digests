Spencer Thomas is correct when he mentions the misinformation that is being
spread about serving beverages (including mead) on 100 per cent nitrogen.
This is fairly common in large wine bars because nitrogen won't cause
oxidation, has no flavor because it doesn't react with water to form
carbonic acid, and is almost insoluble in water.  The tiny amount that does
dissolve in the beverage doesn't produce the large bubbles and carbonic
"bite" we associate with carbonated beer and soft drinks.

Nitrogen regulators use higher pressure gauges on both the cylinder and
dispensing sides because the gas is both stored and typically dispensed at a
higher pressure than CO2, and also have a left-hand thread (so that they
aren't easily confused with CO2 regulators/cylinders).  Both cylinders and
regulators are available from welding gas suppliers (and often sold on eBay
and craigslist).

Pure nitrogen should not be confused with "Guinness gas" or "beer gas,"
typically a 70/30 percent nitrogen/CO2 mixture often used for serving stouts
and other low-carbonated beers with a cascading "nitro pour."
