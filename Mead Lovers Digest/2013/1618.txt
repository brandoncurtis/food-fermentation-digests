Bob, there really isn't any special trick to producing a mead that can hold
for a decade or longer, other than to be sure that whatever you bottle is
stable, perhaps consider adding sulfite just before bottling - more as an
antioxidant than an antimicrobial - and use the highest quality seals
(corks, etc.) that you can afford in those bottles that you want to put
down for an extended period like that.  Meads, especially traditionals and
show meads that have no fruit/vegetable adjuncts, tend to be more tolerant
of a little exposure to oxygen than any fruit wines, so with good bottling
and storage practices (keep those bottles in a cool place where the temp
doesn't fluctuate very much) storage of a decade or longer is possible.  I
had one traditional mead that I made back around 1980 that I kept a bottle
of to celebrate the new millennium.  It held up surprisingly well for
nearly 2 decades - and I didn't even handle it as carefully as I should
have, since it got packed into several non-climate controlled moving boxes
along the way.

I've made meads to lay down  for my three oldest grandkids, I'll be
doing one for the youngest later this year. Other than being very
carefull about sanitation the only thing I've done is go for high ABV.
