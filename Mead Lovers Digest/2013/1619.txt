Our Mead of Poetry is the oldest commercial mead in the world as far as I
know.  We release a half barrel each year.  This year if was 11 years old.
I'd tend towards the highest alcohol content with as much sweetness left
over as you like.

Just opened a bottle labeled '93.  It was dry and bubbly.  Taste was
subtle and much smoother than same batch consumed much earlier.  Best of
luck -- I've never fortified.

I am planning to make a really big mead and lay it down, here are a few
tips and tricks I have gathered from old time mead makers.  Use good solid
natural corks - the long ones, dip in wax, store in a constant temp area on
thier sides, and expect some sediment in the bottles.  I would consider
swapping the Everclear for white Bacardi 151.  The rum flavor will play
well with the honey and increase the complexity of the beverage.

Steve: this is for my unborn child; what a great gift for a 21st birthday
or graduation?
My current plan is as follows:
24lbs honey (1/4th each mangrove, brazilian pepper, palm, and OB; the best
of Florida!)
6.125 gallon batch (the extra quart is for racking loss)
D21 (decided to stick with a yeast I know and love)
Maybe fortified, maybe not, still debating.
My issue is nutrients. I'm really caught up in trying to make it as natural
as possible, but have no show mead experience.
I'm currently compromising by thinking 18g fermaid K, 3g DAP and 12g yeast
hulls, but I'd like to drop the DAP and some of the fermaid, but i don't
want to add any fruit (am I being too picky?). Thoughts?
This will continue to develop and change until about August, when brewing
will commence :)
All comments welcome, and thanks in advance,
    Bob
P.S current oak plan is 2oz french medium in primary, carried over to
secondary (removed at end of ferment); 1oz each american med + and French
heavy for bulk aging (after fortifying if that's what I do). Tasting will
determine end point and if more/less/different oak is needed.
P.P.S. too much info?

I expect the majority of my meads to last a while, with the exception of
melomels. To that end, I like to use strongly flavoured honeys and keep
the OG high. I also like to age the meads in bulk using corny or beer
kegs. That way they are sealed with a CO2 or nitrogen blanket.
After aging I bottle, if needed. Easy to just stack up the kegs and forget
about them as the age. And well worth the wait.
