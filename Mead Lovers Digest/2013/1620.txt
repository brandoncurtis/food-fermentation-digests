Subject: Mojito mead recipe

Our club has aquired a tequlla barrel and will be making a Mojito Mead.  Could
use some help on recipe.

for 5 gal

18# Wildflower honey
71b-1122 yeast
SNA nutrients
ferment 1 month
zest & juice of 4 limes, 2 oz dried mint in secondary

Here's where I need some help.  Add lime zest & lime juice in secondary, or
primary?  Transfer from primary to barrel and add the lime & mint for
conditioning?

We will have a number of novice mead makers on this project, and I am hesitant
to add the lime in primary in case the PH goes out of line.

Comments please.

Thanks,
Mike Tripka
