Mike,

Why not just add the mint and zest to the secondary and freeze the lime
juice?  Then at bottling you can add enough juice to give the flavor you
want without affecting the fermentation.

My vote is for Lime and Mint in the Secondary.

More likely to retain more of the essential oils in the finished product,
and potentially avoid any 'hard lemonade' flavors.  I think I would try
to clean the outside of the limes very well before cutting and adding
(to avoid wild yeasts).

Mileage and opinions may vary.

Thanks,
Jim.

Lime juice in primary "can" be ok if the honey pH is higher, and K2CO3
is used properly. But you may want to avoid it just so the novice mead
makers learn good practices first (like appropriate pH management), then
break the rules later.
Either way zest is so fragrant that I would not waste it in primary.
Mojitos use rum, like juice sugar and spearmint, but tequila and peppermint
are more common. I would try to get my hands on a mix of spearmint and
peppermint for a really good flavor combo.
How big is the barrel? And batch?

If it was me I would use fresh crushed/muddled mint, double the amount of
dry herb.

When I make mead I "pasteurize" the honey at 190 deg with 1/2 volume of
water (1 gal of honey to 1 gal of water) while skimming off any white scum
that comes to the top. Additions like the lime, lime zest and mint I would
add at the end of the skimming process just before I chill it off, so the
flavors infuse in to the must, sounds like an interesting mead, I'd bump up
the lime content by double at least. I just made a lemon mead that I added
1 quart of fresh squeezed lemon juice to a 10 gal batch, it has 2.5 gal
(30#) of wildflower honey, OG was 1110, it probably finish up around 15% abv.

Good Luck!

Hi Mike,

Congrats on the barrel acquisition! I'm sure you know this and don't care,
but mojitos are generally made with light rum. That's not to say that a
mojito mead wouldn't be great after aging in a tequila barrel; in fact, I'm
sure it'll be delicious.

I would strongly advise against putting that much honey in a 5-gal batch of
mint-flavored mead. 18 pounds will finish sweet with most yeasts, and I
think 71b-1122 will leave a lot of honey unfermented. You can expect a
sweet mint mead come out medicinal, and I assume that's not what you're
after. I know a mojito is sweet, but that's mixed fresh, which is somehow
totally different. It's possible that the lime zest and juice will balance
out the cough syruppiness, but I doubt it. If you're using mint, I
recommend making it dry. If you want something really big that's going to
age for a good long time, I might go with a champagne yeast and maybe
slightly less honey. Another option is that you could make a lime mead and
age it in the tequila barrel, and then just serve it chilled on some
crushed mint.

On your actual question, I've had the best results adding things to both
primary and secondary. I think you get an ideal range of flavors by doing
half or a third in primary and then the other half or 2/3 in secondary.
That way, some of it has gone through whatever metamorphosis the yeast
brings about in primary fermentation, and some of it is the
mostly-unadulterated flavor that you added.

It might not be a bad idea to test the pH, but I can't imagine the juice of
a lime or 2 will make that big a difference.

Good luck, and please let us know how it turns out!
