I have been using fresh flowers, mainly dandelions in my meads to supply po=
llen as a yeast nutrient and to add some acidity.
The fermentations with the flowers are more vigorous than those without.

Soaking the flower heads in the water and or boiling the water prior to add=
ing the honey works well. Skim the flowers out with a strainer before you a=
dd the honey (or other ingredients)

Back in 11/2002 I brewed a mead to give to my oldest granddaughter on
her 21st. The alc. level was right at 18%.
After the honey was done fermenting I racked it to a secondary with five
pounds of sweet cherries.
I opened one last night to check it's progress. It as a nice taste of
honey and cherry with a pleasant alcohol warmth that is not hot or harsh
and it's smooth.
I've also done one for both her broters and will be doing one for the
youngest some time this year.
