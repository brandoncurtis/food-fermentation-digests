Hi!,
I live in Brazil And there are maybe 10 mead makers here, Yes, just 10 or
less. Modestly, I produce very good mead And I world like to share this with
more mead lovers. What about an international mead association? This could be
a chance for cultural exchanges and quality improvement. What do You tihink?
Regards, Greg.
