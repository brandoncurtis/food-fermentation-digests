Maybe we could exchange jabuticaba melomel, no one here knows what it is,
and I know it is grown commercially over there.
Seriously though, that is a great idea that need to be done! Polish meads,
scotish meads, Provincial meads, american and south american meads all
being traded freely with each other sound great.

Wild yeast.
I was just wondering if any one had done a wild yeast mead and if so how it
turned out what were some differences good or bad that you noticed in time,
taste, and quality of the final product? There are a couple ancient recipes
out there i would like to try that are wild yeast and I'm looking for some
pointers

this is the "international mead makers association"! its just kinda
informal. im from san diego california, and always like to hear what people
in other parts of the world are up to. we are all global ambassadors,
brought together by our love of mead! mead and especially mead makers
are rarities in almost any community (at least in my experience.). keep
experimenting, and remember that as long as you enjoy the process, and/or
the finished product, and/or the learning process, your doing it right.
