Hello!
  Mexico over here! I have to admit I've tried about 5 batches now... I'm
not really happy about any of these...
I once tried an awesome mead a friend brought from new zealand... Freakin
awesome, since then i've been trying to do a decent one! Still not happy.
 Will keep trying although it's difficult to find good supplies for brewery!
 Any advice is always welcome! And this group has kept me going as i read
 such amazing recipes(not that I try them, i've been sticking to the
 traditional orange recipee i'm sure you all know which one)
 Anyway! Thank you all!
Alberto Colin

I loved the taste of the buckwheat honey.  When I read up on it, l learned
that there is a western buckwheat and an eastern buckwheat, the western
being sweet and the eastern having barnyard qualities.  I made a gallon
batch.  I guess I got the eastern variety.  It fermented very quickly and
cleared in a couple of months. On the first racking, it was very good.  On
the second, the barnyard taste and aroma appeared and is pretty strong.
I'm wondering if the barnyard will disappear with aging, or is there some
flavoring I can use to mask it or neutralize it?  I don't want to pitch it
so any help would be appreciated.
