Regarding this: buckwheat honey makes a fantastic spiced braggot. If you
are unhappy with your mead, try brewing a minimally hopped barley beer
with some chai tea spices added. Mix the two batches & put it away for a
year. Yum.

Hey Alberto!

If you don't like what you're getting...stop making it.  It'll
probably never change into something that you like.

Rather better to consider what you liked about the New Zealand mead
and make something like that.

Think about and write down what you remember about the NZ mead.
Flavors, sweetness, aromas...  what was it like.  Then you can set
about making something that resembles that.

Or, if you want to go in another direction, then do that.

For me, building the recipe is half the fun, and you should never make
something that you don't like.

Making a recipe can be as easy or as complex as you want, but in the
end, it's just fermented honey.

So, come on back, and describe what it is that you want, and you'll
probably find a few folks on here that would be willing to throw in
their two cents.

Mexico over here! I have to admit I've tried about 5 batches now... I'm
not really happy about any of these...
I once tried an awesome mead a friend brought from new zealand... Freakin
awesome, since then i've been trying to do a decent one! Still not happy.

i haven't had new zealand mead,  but have had some special Dasnk Mjod from
denmark,   it's pricey, but they have 4 or 5 spiced meads available here.
 it might comfort you to know that most commercial meads are poor,  and
that is a kind rating.

I have been making mead for 20 years,  i have had some creations worthy of
the gods,  and a few that i wouldn't even clean my cellar floor with.

there are many things that can ruin a mead,  and a few basic principles to
follow.  Good yeast,  real honey,  sterilization,  and balance,   to much
acid blend,  and it's great for marinating mead,  not enough,  and oh well,
kinda dull.

there is lot's of great information out there now.  If i can make a mead
that sings in 1994,  with some research,  luck, and patience,  you can
today.

Can't say if there is anything to the "eastern/western" or buckwheat
honey in general but I can say it is nearly always worth it to wait out
a batch that goes odd in taste, barring something grossly wrong with it,
like an obvious infection. My 1996 (bottled date - presumably started
1994 or 5) batch (no, not buckwheat) was terrible from about 1997 to
2000 or 2001. Then it got better. One of these days I'll have to make
the decision and drink the last bottle.

the "barnyard" mead sounds like a good candidate for a "christmas" mead,
with a clove or two, (they are super pungent) and some cinamon sticks,
or perhaps a vanilla bean. any herbs or spices you like but watch out
because some can add a medicinie taste.

Hello Everybody!
  Has anyone tried Fermaid K? In "The Complete Meadmaker" Schramm says it's
a very close nutrient mix to the one found to be better. However I'm
not sure if this is just yeast nutrients or would it count also as mead
energizer? Should I use separately regular yeast nutrients and regular yeast
energizer and add them accordingly to the Staggered Nutrition Addition? Or
Should I buy Fermaid K and use it as indicated (one pitch 6-12 hours after
inoculation and a second pitch a stationary phase). Or could I get fermaid
K + yeast energizer and follow the Staggered Nutrition Addition?
I hope someone has a better undestanding than me of the chemicals on all
these options and can tell me what would be the best combination and use.
 Thanks!
