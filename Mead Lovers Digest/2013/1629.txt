The 2013 Mazer Cup International was a resounding success, with more
than 60% more meads judged this year vs. 2012. We had meads from all
over the world, and were privileged to judge some seriously fine meads!
Congrats to Doc Bivins (a long time Gotmeader) for his Best of Show win
in the Home competition.

All judging sheets and awards will be mailed out, so if you entered,
watch your mail!

You can view the results on our website at http://www.mazercup.com. And
you can see some of the pictures from the competition and the Mead Mixer
public mead tasting event on our Facebook page

Happy Meading!
Wassail!

Hi,

Since i started meading, I've been using fermaid, no added DAP, at twice
the rate (look up peter bennell and mead about this) with good results.
I also put go-ferm in rehydration solution.

I select yeast with low nutrient requirements: DV10, Spark, etc

To be honest, I have not tried a no added nutrient mead yet - raw honey
was always a bit short supply.  May come, I now have a couple hives :-)

I just bottled my first batch of mead. I sanitized the natural corks
by rinsing them in sanitizing solution, but did not soak them in it
(for an hour per the recommendation, I later realized). Once corked, I
left the bottles standing for 48 hours, then laid them on their sides
in a cool dark place. Will they be okay for months-years, or should I
recork the bottles?

I used the no-heat method, adding potassium metabisulfite and
potassium sorbate after the second racking. Fermentation stopped for a
solid month, and then I noticed the tiniest build up of gas in the
airlock. With the third racking, I added 1/8 tsp potassium
metabisulfite per the recipe, but no sorbate and did not think to
check specific gravity (you live, you learn). The gas build up might
have just been "degassing"? If it was fermentation, did the
metabisulfite kill the process? I can live with sparkling, but not
exploding mead.
