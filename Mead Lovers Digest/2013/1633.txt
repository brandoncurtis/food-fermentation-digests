Dear Meadmakers:
I scanned through Ken Schramm's book [The Complete Meadmaker] but found
nothing on chilling in conjunction with additives like Bentonite or
Isinglass to help get a mead that will remain clear before bottling.  I ask
as I bottled mead and it was perfectly clear.  Then over the next 6 months
I find a very fine brown precipitate in the bottles.
*Question*: Anyone have experience/reference in books/thoughts with adding
clarifying agents AND chilling prior to bottling?
*Question*: Anyone with suggestions on why a mead will form a very fine
precipitate once it has been in the bottle for 6 month - after it set in
the carboys with 2 or 3 racking over 6 month at least?  More racking the
solution?

Has anyone used the Vintner's Harvest fruit purees?  I have two 3 lb cans
of peach that I bought from my local brew shop and I want to make a peach
mead this fall.  Sadly, the Vintner's Harvest website has no practical
information on its use.

Thanks.
