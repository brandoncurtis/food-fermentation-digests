I have used their Blackberry puree, sadly it is still in secondary so I cannot
comment on flavor. I bought it from Leeners and have used their recipe (mostly,
  you know how we are.) They also sell the Peach and the recipe is here:

Hope that is helpful.

I'll sound like a broken record (and the youngsters have no idea what
I'm talking about), but way too much of  hurry. 2-3 rackings over 6
months? try 2-3 rackings 6 months (or more) apart.

I get fine loose crud in the bottom of the fermenter occasionally. I
don't know exactly what or why it is.  I'll bottle it, and run it
through a coffee filter in a glass funnel when drinking time comes.
Doesn't seem to affect the flavor too much - I do use those bottles up
first. Fussier folks might throw it out, but I see no point in wasting
it like that since it both looks and tastes fine once filtered.
Equipment-mad fussy folk might filter on the way into the bottle, but if
it's not done generating crud when you bottle it, that won't help.

They just supply a raw material, and what you do with it is up to you.
You want to make a peach mead or melomel, someone else wants a peach
wine, someone else wants peach wheat beer. In the sue-happy state the US
has gotten to, could be they don't provide information on use to avoid
having customers claiming "I followed the recipe on your website and it
tastes like crap, so you owe me money."

From limited experience, get pretty well through primary fermentation
of the mead before you add the fruit. Otherwise the primary may strip
all (or most of) the flavor out. My first mead was a lovely pink
cranberry thing when it went into the fermenter, and has no trace of
cranberry flavor or color ~17 years later, nor has it since about a
month in. The fruit will of course spark another round, but at least it
will be limited to the sugar in the fruit, as opposed to all the sugar
in the honey as well.
