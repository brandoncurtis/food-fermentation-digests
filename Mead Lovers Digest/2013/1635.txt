Subject: Lavender Mead

I am interested in making a lavender mead using lavender from my garden
and have several questions:

1.  When adding lavender, is it best to use a simple sugar made with the
lavender or the lavender buds/flowers?
2.  Are there issues with possible bacterial contamination if using the
flowers/buds without some form of sterilization?  Campden wash perhaps?
3.  Is the lavender best added to the primary, or will the flavor be more
redolent if added to the secondary?
4.  Are there any recommendations as to the amount of lavender per 5
gallon batch?
5.  Is there any to add a slight lavender hue to the mead before bottling?

Thank you for your assistance

Dear Mead Makers
I add 3 tsp of a yeast nutrient when I first make the wort [honey, water,
and yeast] and measure the specific gravity.  After about two weeks of
fermentation and I transfer to a glass carboy for the first time I add an
additional 2 tsp of yeast nutrient.  However, based on the specific gravity
measurement after the first two weeks of fermentation, its is done.
Fermented to dryness!
Question:  Given I have fermented to dryness, what if anything does adding
additional yeast nutrient do?
