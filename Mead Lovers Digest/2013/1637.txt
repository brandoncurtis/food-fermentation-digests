A book I read in wine chemistry class indicated that alcohol and pH of
wine even at low doses destroys eColi and Salmonella as well as a myriad
of other harmful organisms either on contact or withing minutes of
contact. It might be interesting to investigate further.

But back to the topic, I agree that keeping the nutrients to a minimum
is a good idea.  When we first started producing mead commercially in
1995 we had the help of some yeast experts who helped us create our
staggered nutrient addition method that many people are currently using
(under one name or another) and have since its inception been tweaking
it to the point where a typical fermentation takes only 2 weeks for a
12%ABV mead.
