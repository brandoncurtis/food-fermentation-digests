To Whom it May Concern,

Please post the following.

As a novice mead maker, I have about 10 small batches under my belt.
I am focusing on making mead that can be served young.  I have run across
two problems which are probably common to the more experienced members.
Here is a typical base recipe.

Initial Gravity: ~1.135
Yeast: DV-10 or 58W3
Volume: 1gallon
Additions: dark tea, raisins, various fruit juices (less than 1/3 of the
consumable sugars)
Primary: 2-4 weeks
2nd racking: 1 month after primary
Nutrient: 1/4tsp at pitch, 1/4tsp at 2 days

1 = Carbonation.  I want to produce still mead.  After 3 months (primary
and 1 or 2 rackings) I still have a significant amount of carbonation
in the mead in the carboys.  It tends to hide the true flavor.  My only
two solutions so far are opening a bottle 1 day prior to serving to
let it go flat, or using a wine saver to pump the CO2 out of the mead.
Any recommendation on how to degas prior to bottling?

2 = I recently started using an energizer and nutrient due to low yields.
This has increased my sugar consumption and decreased primary fermentation
times.  However, even at half the recommended doses their is a very
noticeable bitter flavor.  Was this caused by the rapid fermentation or
am I tasting left over nutrients?

Thanks in advance for the advice.
