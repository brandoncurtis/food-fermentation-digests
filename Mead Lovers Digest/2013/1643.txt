Carl,

I'll toss in my two cents and suggest that there are some problems with this
being a been that you can serve young.   At that gravity (1.135) it's a big
mead that will likely need extended aging.   For me primary might be a month
or two, then I'd age this for 6 to 12 months or longer (depending on taste
as we go along) before kegging or bottling.    You are on the right approach
to staggered nutrient additions; mind is 1/4 tsp/gal at pitching, then 1/4
tsp/gal in 24 hours, then again in 48 hours.   I rehydrate the dry yeast
(71B) in a solution of the initial nutrients and water at 100oF.   I aerate
the must to oxygenate well; I use O2.    At the end of fermentation you will
have 1 volume of CO2 in solution.   You need to gently agitate the mead so
as not to introduce O2 but to get as much CO2 out of solution as possible.
I suspect you are still getting a good deal of fermentation even after you
think its done.   Wait a lot longer before bottling.

The best meads I've made for relatively quick consumption had an OG of about
1.070 (hydromel), used orange blossom homey and used 71B yeast.   At the
lower gravity it was very good in 3 months and two rackings.

Could be that you are using too much nutrient and energizer; what you
pitched should have be consumed.  But then it may be that the gravity was
just too high for the yeast to have been able to make use of what was
pitched or still was at bottling.   I've never had a problem tasting the
yeast nutrients, but then I have let fermentation go to completion.
