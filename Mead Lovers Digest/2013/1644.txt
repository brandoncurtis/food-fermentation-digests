Hello All,

First, I would like to thank all of you for your very helpful input into my
recent query on lavender mead.
I have a 5 gallon batch in secondary and it looks and tastes fantastic,
even at this early stage.

For my next batch, I am interested in making a pyment using concord grapes
that I have recently harvested from my garden.

Questions:

1. For a five gallon batch using 12 lbs of honey, what is the optimal
amount of grapes needed?

2. I have read that the grapes should be crushed in a strained bag and
placed in the primary with the honey and water.  Should I freeze the grapes
first or use a Campden tablet? before adding the honey.

3.  Is a starter necessary?  Pectin?

4.  Are the grapes in the strainer bag removed when racking to secondary?

5.  What is the optimal OG?

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

jose
