Jose,

I've made a lot of melomel, and my favorite is a catawba pyment, but I
also make a small batch of concord from my own vines.  In all my
melomels, I use only juice and honey.

I have a Squeezo that I use to juice the grapes.   If you don't have
one of these indispensable kitchen tools yet, a good alternative would
be to freeze them, then thaw and crush.  Strain and press the pulp
through a conical strainer with a wooden pestle.

I represent the pasteurization school.  I bring the juice to 160
degrees F (flash pasteurization temp)., then add the honey, and allow
to slowly cool (covered!) until the must is cool enough to rack and
pitch the yeast.

Good meading,

- -zz
