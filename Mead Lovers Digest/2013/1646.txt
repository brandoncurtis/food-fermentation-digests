 I generally extract the juice from fruit in a pressure cooker, so it is
certainly sterilized by
the process, although the main purpose is to eliminate seed, skin, and pulp
so I don't have to deal with them.
A large pressure cooker for canning can usually be found on Craig's list or
a thrift store for almost nothing.   A pot that will fit in the cooker, a
colander to fit in the top of the pot (leaving room for the juice underneath
it) and you are good to go.
Use maybe a half inch of water and a grill off the top of a range to keep
the pot out of the water, crank it up to 15Lbs for 20 minutes or so, then
take it outside and let it cool.  Presto: (maybe a pun)  Seed and pulp free
juice, sterilized and ready to use as soon as it cools or freeze for later.
I do all kinds of fruit (even grapes) this way.  The pressurized steam
breaks
 the cell walls and releases the juice, which then collects in the pot under
the colander.
The pressure vessel also prevents most of the flavor volatiles from venting
out when it boils, and allows them to condense back into the juice as it
cools.
