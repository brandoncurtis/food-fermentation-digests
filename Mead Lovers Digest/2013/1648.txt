I would love to hear any rebuttals to this pressure cooker method regarding
Cons. The Pro's are listed above and it is very tempting, however my
enology courses are kicking in a red flag screaming not to do this. Can
anyone verify or discredit my concerns? I fear that the heat induced by the
pressure cooking would alter the flavor compounds and leave the juice
tasting more "cooked". Thanks!

Graham,

Why do you juice, then freeze and thaw?  Did you mean this the other
way round?

If you have a way to juice your fruit, you can simply pasteurize and
deactivate any microbes without overheating.

Hoping for the best is a sure recipe for disaster.  Unless you're
drinking it as fast as you're making it, your mead will surely end up
as vinegar.
