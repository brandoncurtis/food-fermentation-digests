Subject: 2014 American Homebrewers Associations National Homebrewers - Mead

Hi - I just joined today, but I wanted to get a message out to anyone who
might have interest.

The 2014 AHA NHC will be held in Grand Rapids, Michigan on June 12th - June
14th, 2014. Registration for the event will begin this coming January,
and next month there will be a call for speakers. Typically there are
approximately 40+ speaker sessions available. The conference is expected
to host 4,000 homebrewers from around the country, and sessions could
approach 1,000 members each.

As the co-chair of the volunteer effort, I am attempting to create day long
speaker tracks on both mead and cider. While in years past there have been
speakers on these topics, there typically hasn't been the concentrated
effort to ensure a day long track of speakers have the opportunity to
collaborate and work together to provide as much good information on how
to create the best meads and ciders possible.

Additionally, I am encouraging those who plan to attend this conference to
consider bringing kegs of mead and cider for shifts during the hospitality
suite as well as if their clubs are participating in Club Night. For
instance, one of my clubs (the Ann Arbor Brewers Guild) is making twelve
5 gallon batches of mead using different yeasts to provide enough for a
tap takeover of one of the bars at the conference next year (and a similar
effort for cider on another night).

If you have a deep breadth of mead making skills and you would like to be
considered to collaborate & speak on this subject, I will be sharing the
link where potential speakers can submit a brief abstract on what they
would like to present. I anticipate that this link will go live in just a
few weeks. If you have any recommendations, please provide their contact
information (not just a name) and what you know about their expertise. These
presentations are put on gratis, but speakers get comp'ed for the conference
(and a guaranteed ticket is a hot commodity seeing as 3,400 tickets sold
out in less than a day last year, and that included a 15 hour server crash).

If you want to recommend someone,
please feel free to contact both me and Craig Belanger
(lincman@comcast.net)
Craig is the conference Speaker coordinator.
