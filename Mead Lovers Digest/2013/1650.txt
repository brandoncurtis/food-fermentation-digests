This may be a dumb discussion but do meads get light struck in the same
manner as white whines? I am wanting to know more about what exactly causes
this to happen and if there is a way to prevent it. For example to pre treat
to prevent light struck and then uv sterilize to clear an infection. If the
process is alcohol dependent then perhaps uv sterilize the must. Looking
for a more reliable way of preventing infection or treating infection.

Cheers,
Jack
